100.1. These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players, including two-player games and multiplayer games.
100.2. To play, each player needs their own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.
100.3. Some cards require coins or traditional dice. Some casual variants require additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional Magic cards, and specialized dice.
100.4. Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match. Sideboard rules and restrictions for some formats are modified by the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents).
100.5. If a deck must contain at least a certain number of cards, that number is referred to as a minimum deck size. There is no maximum deck size for non-Commander decks.
100.6. Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards from some older sets.
100.7. Certain cards are intended for casual play and may have features and text that arenâ€™t covered by these rules. These include Mystery Booster playtest cards, promotional cards and cards in â€œUn-setsâ€� that were printed with a silver border, and cards in the Unfinityâ„¢ expansion that have an acorn symbol at the bottom of the card.
101.1. Whenever a cardâ€™s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule 104.3a).
101.2. When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it canâ€™t happen, the â€œcanâ€™tâ€� effect takes precedence.
101.3. Any part of an instruction thatâ€™s impossible to perform is ignored. (In many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if it doesnâ€™t, thereâ€™s no effect.)
101.4. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active playerâ€™s left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the â€œActive Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) orderâ€� rule.
102.1. A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players.
102.2. In a two-player game, a playerâ€™s opponent is the other player.
102.3. In a multiplayer game between teams, a playerâ€™s teammates are the other players on their team, and the playerâ€™s opponents are all players not on their team.
102.4. A spell or ability may use the term â€œyour teamâ€� as shorthand for â€œyou and/or your teammates.â€� In a game that isnâ€™t a multiplayer game between teams, â€œyour teamâ€� means the same thing as â€œyou.â€�
103.1. At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The gameâ€™s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.
103.2. Some games require additional steps that are taken after the starting player has been determined. Perform the actions listed in 103.2aâ€“e in order, as applicable.
103.3. After the starting player has been determined and any additional steps performed, each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponentsâ€™ decks. The playersâ€™ decks become their libraries.
103.4. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different starting life totals.
103.5. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some effects can modify a playerâ€™s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that playerâ€™s opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further mulligans.
103.6. Some cards allow a player to take actions with them from their opening hand. Once the mulligan process (see rule 103.5) is complete, the starting player may take any such actions in any order. Then each other player in turn order may do the same.
103.7. In a Planechase game, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If itâ€™s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane. (See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�)
103.8. The starting player takes their first turn.
104.1. A game ends immediately when a player wins, when the game is a draw, or when the game is restarted.
104.2. There are several ways to win the game.
104.3. There are several ways to lose the game.
104.4. There are several ways for the game to be a draw.
104.5. If a player loses the game, that player leaves the game. If the game is a draw for a player, that player leaves the game. The multiplayer rules handle what happens when a player leaves the game; see rule 800.4.
104.6. One card (Karn Liberated) restarts the game. All players still in the game when it restarts then immediately begin a new game. See rule 726, â€œRestarting the Game.â€�
105.1. There are five colors in the Magic game: white, blue, black, red, and green.
105.2. An object can be one or more of the five colors, or it can be no color at all. An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame. An objectâ€™s color or colors may also be defined by a color indicator or a characteristic-defining ability. See rule 202.2.
105.3. Effects may change an objectâ€™s color or give a color to a colorless object. If an effect gives an object a new color, the new color replaces all previous colors the object had (unless the effect said the object became that color â€œin additionâ€� to its other colors). Effects may also make a colored object become colorless.
105.4. If a player is asked to choose a color, they must choose one of the five colors. â€œMulticoloredâ€� is not a color. Neither is â€œcolorless.â€�
105.5. If an effect refers to a color pair, it means exactly two of the five colors. There are ten color pairs: white and blue, white and black, blue and black, blue and red, black and red, black and green, red and green, red and white, green and white, and green and blue.
106.1. Mana is the primary resource in the game. Players spend mana to pay costs, usually when casting spells and activating abilities.
106.2. Mana is represented by mana symbols (see rule 107.4). Mana symbols also represent mana costs (see rule 202).
106.3. Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see rule 605). It may also be produced by the effects of spells, as well as by the effects of abilities that arenâ€™t mana abilities. A spell or ability that produces mana instructs a player to add that mana. If mana is produced by a spell, the source of that mana is that spell. If mana is produced by an ability, the source of that mana is the source of that ability (see rule 113.7).
106.4. When an effect instructs a player to add mana, that mana goes into a playerâ€™s mana pool. From there, it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay in the playerâ€™s mana pool as unspent mana. Each playerâ€™s mana pool empties at the end of each step and phase, and the player is said to lose this mana. Cards with abilities that produce mana or refer to unspent mana have received errata in the Oracleâ„¢ card reference to no longer explicitly refer to the mana pool.
106.5. If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.
106.6. Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana can be spent, have an additional effect that affects the spell or ability that mana is spent on, or create a delayed triggered ability (see rule 603.7a) that triggers when that mana is spent. This doesnâ€™t affect the manaâ€™s type.
106.7. Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another permanent or permanents â€œcould produce.â€� The type of mana a permanent could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of that permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time, taking into account any applicable replacement effects in any possible order. Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be paid. If that permanent wouldnâ€™t produce any mana under these conditions, or no type of mana can be defined this way, thereâ€™s no type of mana it could produce.
106.8. If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a playerâ€™s mana pool, that player chooses one half of that symbol. If a colored half is chosen, one mana of that color is added to that playerâ€™s mana pool. If a generic half is chosen, an amount of colorless mana represented by that halfâ€™s number is added to that playerâ€™s mana pool.
106.9. If an effect would add mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol to a playerâ€™s mana pool, one mana of the color of that symbol is added to that playerâ€™s mana pool.
106.10. If an effect would add mana represented by a generic mana symbol to a playerâ€™s mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to that playerâ€™s mana pool.
106.11. If an effect would add mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols to a playerâ€™s mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to that playerâ€™s mana pool.
106.12. To â€œtap [a permanent] for manaâ€� is to activate a mana ability of that permanent that includes the {T} symbol in its activation cost. See rule 605, â€œMana Abilities.â€�
106.13. One card (Drain Power) causes one player to lose unspent mana and another to add â€œthe mana lost this way.â€� (Note that these may be the same player.) This empties the former playerâ€™s mana pool and causes the mana emptied this way to be put into the latter playerâ€™s mana pool. Which permanents, spells, and/or abilities produced that mana are unchanged, as are any restrictions or additional effects associated with any of that mana.
107.1. The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.
107.2. If anything needs to use a number that canâ€™t be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it uses 0 instead.
107.3. Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects have abilities that define the value of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.
107.4. The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, and {C}; the numerical symbols {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and so on; the variable symbol {X}; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B}, {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W}, {G/W}, and {G/U}; the monocolored hybrid symbols {2/W}, {2/U}, {2/B}, {2/R}, {2/G}, {C/W}, {C/U}, {C/B}, {C/R}, and {C/G}; the Phyrexian mana symbols {W/P}, {U/P}, {B/P}, {R/P}, and {G/P}; the hybrid Phyrexian symbols {W/U/P}, {W/B/P}, {U/B/P}, {U/R/P}, {B/R/P}, {B/G/P}, {R/G/P}, {R/W/P}, {G/W/P}, and {G/U/P}; and the snow mana symbol {S}.
107.5. The tap symbol is {T}. The tap symbol in an activation cost means â€œTap this permanent.â€� A permanent thatâ€™s already tapped canâ€™t be tapped again to pay the cost. A creatureâ€™s activated ability with the tap symbol in its activation cost canâ€™t be activated unless the creature has been under its controllerâ€™s control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.
107.6. The untap symbol is {Q}. The untap symbol in an activation cost means â€œUntap this permanent.â€� A permanent thatâ€™s already untapped canâ€™t be untapped again to pay the cost. A creatureâ€™s activated ability with the untap symbol in its activation cost canâ€™t be activated unless the creature has been under its controllerâ€™s control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.
107.7. Each activated ability of a planeswalker has a loyalty symbol in its cost. Positive loyalty symbols point upward and feature a plus sign followed by a number. Negative loyalty symbols point downward and feature a minus sign followed by a number or an X. Neutral loyalty symbols donâ€™t point in either direction and feature a 0. [+N] means â€œPut N loyalty counters on this permanent,â€� [-N] means â€œRemove N loyalty counters from this permanent,â€� and [0] means â€œPut zero loyalty counters on this permanent.â€� Loyalty symbols may also appear in abilities that modify loyalty costs.
107.8. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as â€œN1-N2,â€� or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as â€œN3+.â€� Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as â€œ[P/T].â€� See rule 711, â€œLeveler Cards.â€�
107.9. A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many Odysseyâ„¢ block cards with abilities that are relevant in a playerâ€™s graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when theyâ€™re in a graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.
107.10. A type icon appears in the upper left corner of each card from the Future Sightâ„¢ set printed with an alternate â€œtimeshiftedâ€� frame. If the card has a single card type, this icon indicates what it is: claw marks for creature, a flame for sorcery, a lightning bolt for instant, a sunrise for enchantment, a chalice for artifact, and a pair of mountain peaks for land. If the card has multiple card types, thatâ€™s indicated by a black and white cross. This icon has no effect on game play.
107.11. The Planeswalker symbol is {PW}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual variant. It has five tines at the top and tapers to a point at the bottom. See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�
107.12. The chaos symbol is {CHAOS}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual variant, as well as in abilities that refer to the results of rolling the planar die. It looks like a swirling vortex. See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�
107.13. A color indicator is a circular symbol that appears to the left of the type line on some cards. The color of the symbol defines the cardâ€™s color or colors. See rule 202, â€œMana Cost and Color.â€�
107.14. The energy symbol is {E}. It represents one energy counter. To pay {E}, a player removes one energy counter from themselves.
107.15. The text box of a Saga card contains chapter symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability. A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as â€œrNâ€�. The text printed in the text box striation to the right of a chapter symbol is the effect of the triggered ability it represents. See rule 714, â€œSaga Cards.â€�
107.16. The text box of a Class card contains class level bars, each of which is a keyword ability that represents both an activated ability and a static ability. A class level bar includes the activation cost of its activated ability and a level number. Any abilities printed within the same text box section as the class level bar are part of its static ability. See rule 716, â€œClass Cards.â€�
107.17. The ticket symbol is {TK}. It represents one ticket counter.
107.18. The pawprint symbol is {P}. This symbol is used to indicate the modes on some modal spells, and does not represent a cost, mana, counters, or any type of persistent resource. See rule 700.2i.
108.1. Use the Oracle card reference when determining a cardâ€™s wording. A cardâ€™s Oracle text can be found using the Gatherer card database at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
108.2. When a rule or text on a card refers to a â€œcard,â€� it means only a Magic card or an object represented by a Magic card.
108.3. The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in their deck. If a card is brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a playerâ€™s deck, its owner is the player who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner is the player who put it into the command zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game rules except for the rules for ante. (See rule 407.)
108.4. A card doesnâ€™t have a controller unless that card represents a permanent or spell; in those cases, its controller is determined by the rules for permanents or spells. See rules 110.2 and 112.2.
108.5. Nontraditional Magic cards canâ€™t start the game in any zone other than the command zone (see rule 408). If an effect would bring a nontraditional Magic card other than a dungeon card (see rule 309, â€œDungeonsâ€�) into the game from outside the game, it doesnâ€™t; that card remains outside the game.
108.6. For more information about cards, see section 2, â€œParts of a Card.â€�
109.1. An object is an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, a permanent, or an emblem.
109.2. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but doesnâ€™t refer to a specific zone or include the word â€œcard,â€� â€œspell,â€� â€œsource,â€� or â€œscheme,â€� it means a permanent of that card type or subtype on the battlefield.
109.3. An objectâ€™s characteristics are name, mana cost, color, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, defense, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isnâ€™t a characteristic. For example, characteristics donâ€™t include whether a permanent is tapped, a spellâ€™s target, an objectâ€™s owner or controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.
109.4. Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller. Objects that are neither on the stack nor on the battlefield arenâ€™t controlled by any player. See rule 108.4. There are six exceptions to this rule:
109.5. The words â€œyouâ€� and â€œyourâ€� on an object refer to the objectâ€™s controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to play, cast, or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static ability, this is the current controller of the object itâ€™s on. For an activated ability, this is the player who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability triggered, unless itâ€™s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7dâ€“f.
110.1. A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield. A permanent remains on the battlefield indefinitely. A card or token becomes a permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent as itâ€™s moved to another zone by an effect or rule.
110.2. A permanentâ€™s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it (unless itâ€™s a token; see rule 111.2). A permanentâ€™s controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the battlefield. Every permanent has a controller.
110.3. A nontoken permanentâ€™s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule 613, â€œInteraction of Continuous Effects.â€�
110.4. There are six permanent types: artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Instant and sorcery cards canâ€™t enter the battlefield and thus canâ€™t be permanents. Some kindred cards can enter the battlefield and some canâ€™t, depending on their other card types. See section 3, â€œCard Types.â€�
110.5. A permanentâ€™s status is its physical state. There are four status categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.
111.1. Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that isnâ€™t represented by a card.
111.2. The player who creates a token is its owner. The token enters the battlefield under that playerâ€™s control.
111.3. The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for the token. This becomes the tokenâ€™s â€œtext.â€� The characteristic values defined this way are functionally equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the tokenâ€™s copiable values. A token doesnâ€™t have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it.
111.4. A spell or ability that creates a token sets both its name and its subtype(s). If the spell or ability doesnâ€™t specify the name of the token, its name is the same as its subtype(s) plus the word â€œToken.â€� Once a token is on the battlefield, changing its name doesnâ€™t change its subtype(s), and vice versa.
111.5. If a spell or ability would create a token, but a rule or effect states that a permanent with one or more of that tokenâ€™s characteristics canâ€™t enter the battlefield, the token is not created. Similarly, if an effect would create a token that is a copy of an instant or sorcery card, no token is created.
111.6. A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the tokenâ€™s card type or subtype. A token isnâ€™t a card (even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came from a Magic booster pack).
111.7. A token thatâ€™s in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; see rule 704. (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token ceases to exist.)
111.8. A token that has left the battlefield canâ€™t move to another zone or come back onto the battlefield. If such a token would change zones, it remains in its current zone instead. It ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked; see rule 704.
111.9. Some effects instruct a player to create a legendary token. These may be written â€œcreate [name], a . . .â€� and list characteristics for the token. This is the same as an instruction to create a token with the listed characteristics that has the given name. 
111.10. Some effects instruct a player to create a predefined token. These effects use the definition below to determine the characteristics the token is created with. The effect that creates a predefined token may also modify or add to the predefined characteristics.
111.11. If an effect instructs a player to create a token by name, doesnâ€™t define any other characteristics for that token, and the name is not one of the types in the list of predefined tokens above, that player uses the card with that name in the Oracle card reference to determine the characteristics of that token.
111.12. If an effect instructs a player to create a token that is a copy of a nonexistent object, no token is created (see rule 707, â€œCopying Objectsâ€�). This does not apply to an effect that would use the last known information of an object.
111.13. A copy of a permanent spell becomes a token as it resolves. The token has the characteristics of the spell that became that token. The token is not â€œcreatedâ€� for the purposes of any replacement effects or triggered abilities that refer to creating a token.
112.1. A spell is a card on the stack. As the first step of being cast (see rule 601, â€œCasting Spellsâ€�), the card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its ownerâ€™s hand. (See rule 405, â€œStack.â€�) A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule 608, â€œResolving Spells and Abilitiesâ€�), is countered (see rule 701.6), or otherwise leaves the stack. For more information, see section 6, â€œSpells, Abilities, and Effects.â€�
112.2. A spellâ€™s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it, unless itâ€™s a copy. In that case, the owner of the spell is the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A spellâ€™s controller is, by default, the player who put it on the stack. Every spell has a controller.
112.3. A noncopy spellâ€™s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule 613, â€œInteraction of Continuous Effects.â€�
112.4. If an effect of a resolving spell or ability changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the effect continues to apply to the permanent when the spell resolves. See rule 400.7.
113.1. An ability can be one of three things:
113.2. Abilities can affect the objects theyâ€™re on. They can also affect other objects and/or players.
113.3. There are four general categories of abilities:
113.4. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow special rules: They donâ€™t use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana abilities even if they donâ€™t have priority. See rule 605, â€œMana Abilities.â€�
113.5. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn. See rule 606, â€œLoyalty Abilities.â€�
113.6. Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while that object is on the stack. Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is on the battlefield. The exceptions are as follows:
113.7. The source of an ability is the object that generated it. The source of an activated ability on the stack is the object whose ability was activated. The source of a triggered ability (other than a delayed triggered ability) on the stack, or one that has triggered and is waiting to be put on the stack, is the object whose ability triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7dâ€“f.
113.8. The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability on the stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the abilityâ€™s source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the abilityâ€™s source when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7dâ€“f.
113.9. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack arenâ€™t spells, and therefore canâ€™t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities. Static abilities donâ€™t use the stack and thus canâ€™t be countered at all.
113.10. Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the object â€œgainsâ€� or â€œhasâ€� that ability, or similar. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object â€œlosesâ€� that ability.
113.11. Effects can stop an object from having a specified ability. These effects say that the object â€œcanâ€™t haveâ€� that ability. If the object has that ability, it loses it. Itâ€™s also impossible for an effect or keyword counter to add that ability to the object. If a resolving spell or ability creates a continuous effect that would add the specified ability to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts of that continuous effect will still apply, and that resolving spell or ability can still create other continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static abilities that would add the specified ability wonâ€™t apply to that object.
113.12. An effect that sets an objectâ€™s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object â€œgainsâ€� or â€œhasâ€� an ability, that ability can be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (â€œ[permanent] is [characteristic value]â€�), itâ€™s not granting an ability. (See rule 604.3.) Similarly, if an effect states a quality of that object (â€œ[creature] canâ€™t be blocked,â€� for example), itâ€™s neither granting an ability nor setting a characteristic.
114.1. Some effects put emblems into the command zone. An emblem is a marker used to represent an object that has one or more abilities, but usually no other characteristics.
114.2. An effect that creates an emblem is written â€œ[Player] gets an emblem with [ability].â€� This means that [player] puts an emblem with [ability] into the command zone. The emblem is both owned and controlled by that player.
114.3. An emblem has no characteristics other than the abilities defined by the effect that created it. In particular, an emblem has no types, no mana cost, and no color. Most emblems also have no name.
114.4. Abilities of emblems function in the command zone.
114.5. An emblem is neither a card nor a permanent. Emblem isnâ€™t a card type.
115.1. Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or more targets for them. The targets are object(s) and/or player(s) the spell or ability will affect. These targets are declared as part of the process of putting the spell or ability on the stack. The targets canâ€™t be changed except by another spell or ability that explicitly says it can do so.
115.2. Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability (a) specifies that it can target an object in another zone or a player, or (b) targets an object that canâ€™t exist on the battlefield, such as a spell or ability. See also rule 115.4.
115.3. The same target canâ€™t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word â€œtargetâ€� on a spell or ability. If the spell or ability uses the word â€œtargetâ€� in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word â€œtargetâ€� (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). This rule applies both when choosing targets for a spell or ability and when changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability (see rule 115.7).
115.4. Some spells and abilities that refer to damage require â€œany target,â€� â€œanother target,â€� â€œtwo targets,â€� or similar rather than â€œtarget [something].â€� These targets may be creatures, players, planeswalkers, or battles. Other game objects, such as noncreature artifacts or spells, canâ€™t be chosen.
115.5. A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.
115.6. A spell or ability that requires targets may allow zero targets to be chosen. Such a spell or ability is still said to require targets, but that spell or ability is targeted only if one or more targets have been chosen for it.
115.7. Some effects allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, and other effects allow a player to choose new targets for a spell or ability.
115.8. Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that allows a player to change the target(s) of a modal spell or ability, or to choose new targets for a modal spell or ability, doesnâ€™t allow that player to change its mode. (See rule 700.2.)
115.9. Some objects check what another spell or ability is targeting. Depending on the wording, these may check the current state of the targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both.
115.10. Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they donâ€™t target. In general, those objects and players arenâ€™t chosen until the spell or ability resolves. See rule 608, â€œResolving Spells and Abilities.â€�
116.1. Special actions are actions a player may take when they have priority that donâ€™t use the stack. These are not to be confused with turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates automatically. (See rule 703, â€œTurn-Based Actions,â€� and rule 704, â€œState-Based Actions.â€�)
116.2. There are twelve special actions:
116.3. If a player takes a special action, that player receives priority afterward.
117.1. Unless a spell or ability is instructing a player to take an action, which player can take actions at any given time is determined by a system of priority. The player with priority may cast spells, activate abilities, and take special actions.
117.2. Other kinds of abilities and actions are automatically generated or performed by the game rules, or are performed by players without receiving priority.
117.3. Which player has priority is determined by the following rules:
117.4. If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.
117.5. Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all applicable state-based actions as a single event (see rule 704, â€œState-Based Actionsâ€�), then repeats this process until no state-based actions are performed. Then triggered abilities are put on the stack (see rule 603, â€œHandling Triggered Abilitiesâ€�). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the player who would have received priority does so.
117.6. In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, teams rather than individual players have priority. See rule 805, â€œShared Team Turns Option.â€�
117.7. If a player with priority casts a spell or activates an activated ability while another spell or ability is already on the stack, the new spell or ability has been cast or activated â€œin response toâ€� the earlier spell or ability. The new spell or ability will resolve first. See rule 608, â€œResolving Spells and Abilities.â€�
118.1. A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that contains that cost.
118.2. If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a chance to activate mana abilities. Paying the cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability follows the steps in rules 601.2fâ€“h.
118.3. A player canâ€™t pay a cost without having the necessary resources to pay it fully. For example, a player with only 1 life canâ€™t pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent thatâ€™s already tapped canâ€™t be tapped to pay a cost. See rule 202, â€œMana Cost and Color,â€� and rule 602, â€œActivating Activated Abilities.â€�
118.4. Some costs include an {X} or an X. See rule 107.3.
118.5. Some costs are represented by {0}, or are reduced to {0}. The action necessary for a player to pay such a cost is the playerâ€™s acknowledgment that they are paying it. Even though such a cost requires no resources, itâ€™s not automatically paid.
118.6. Some objects have no mana cost. This represents an unpayable cost. An ability can also have an unpayable cost if its cost is based on the mana cost of an object with no mana cost. Attempting to cast a spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action. However, attempting to pay an unpayable cost is an illegal action.
118.7. What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or reduced by effects. If the mana component of a cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, itâ€™s considered to be {0}. Paying a cost changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.
118.8. Some spells and abilities have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a spellâ€™s rules text, or applied to a spell or ability from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same time they pay the spellâ€™s mana cost or the abilityâ€™s activation cost. Note that some additional costs are listed in keywords; see rule 702.
118.9. Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spellâ€™s text, or applied to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spellâ€™s mana cost. Alternative costs are usually phrased, â€œYou may [action] rather than pay [this objectâ€™s] mana cost,â€� or â€œYou may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost.â€� Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule 702.
118.10. Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player canâ€™t sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesnâ€™t pay another spell or abilityâ€™s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.
118.11. The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the actions that are performed donâ€™t match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.
118.12. Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, â€œ[Do something]. If [a player] [does, doesnâ€™t, or canâ€™t], [effect].â€� Or â€œ[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does, doesnâ€™t, or canâ€™t], [effect].â€� The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The â€œIf [a player] [does, doesnâ€™t, or canâ€™t]â€� clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.
118.13. Some costs contain mana symbols that can be paid in multiple ways. These include hybrid mana symbols and Phyrexian mana symbols.
118.14. Some effects say that â€œmana of any type can be spentâ€� to pay a cost. This means that players may spend mana as though it were colorless mana or mana of any color to pay that cost. If that effect also gives a player permission to cast spells, this applies only to mana that player spends to cast spells that way. See rule 609.4b.
119.1. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different starting life totals.
119.1d. In a two-player Brawl game, each playerâ€™s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each playerâ€™s starting life total is 30. See rule 903.12, â€œBrawl Option.â€�
119.2. Damage dealt to a player normally causes that player to lose that much life. See rule 120.3.
119.3. If an effect causes a player to gain life or lose life, that playerâ€™s life total is adjusted accordingly.
119.4. If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0, the player may do so only if their life total is greater than or equal to the amount of the payment. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted from their life total; in other words, the player loses that much life.
119.5. If an effect sets a playerâ€™s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total.
119.6. If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See rule 704.
119.7. If an effect says that a player canâ€™t gain life, that player canâ€™t make an exchange such that the playerâ€™s life total would become higher; in that case, the exchange wonâ€™t happen. Similarly, if an effect redistributes life totals, a player canâ€™t receive a new life total such that the playerâ€™s life total would become higher. In addition, a cost that involves having that player gain life canâ€™t be paid, and a replacement effect that would replace a life gain event affecting that player wonâ€™t do anything.
119.8. If an effect says that a player canâ€™t lose life, that player canâ€™t make an exchange such that the playerâ€™s life total would become lower; in that case, the exchange wonâ€™t happen. Similarly, if an effect redistributes life totals, a player canâ€™t receive a new life total such that the playerâ€™s life total would become lower. In addition, a cost that involves having that player pay life canâ€™t be paid.
119.9. Some triggered abilities are written, â€œWhenever [a player] gains life, . . . .â€� Such abilities are treated as though they are written, â€œWhenever a source causes [a player] to gain life, . . . .â€� If a player gains 0 life, no life gain event has occurred, and these abilities wonâ€™t trigger.
119.10. Some replacement effects are written, â€œIf [a player] would gain life, . . . .â€� Such abilities are treated as though they are written, â€œIf a source would cause [a player] to gain life, . . . .â€� If a player gains 0 life, no life gain event would occur, and these effects wonâ€™t apply.
120.1. Objects can deal damage to battles, creatures, planeswalkers, and players. This is generally detrimental to the object or player that receives that damage. An object that deals damage is the source of that damage.
120.2. Any object can deal damage.
120.3. Damage may have one or more of the following results, depending on whether the recipient of the damage is a player or permanent, the characteristics of the damageâ€™s source, and the characteristics of the damageâ€™s recipient (if itâ€™s a permanent).
120.4. Damage is processed in a four-part sequence.
120.5. Damage dealt to a creature, planeswalker, or battle doesnâ€™t destroy it. Likewise, the source of that damage doesnâ€™t destroy it. Rather, state-based actions may destroy a creature or otherwise put a permanent into its ownerâ€™s graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt to that permanent. See rule 704.
120.6. Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if that permanent stops being a creature. If the total damage marked on a creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule 704). All damage marked on a permanent is removed when it regenerates (see rule 701.19, â€œRegenerateâ€�) and during the cleanup step (see rule 514.2).
120.7. The source of damage is the object that dealt it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a prevention or replacement effect thatâ€™s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability thatâ€™s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesnâ€™t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. See rule 609.7, â€œSources of Damage.â€�
120.8. If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on damage being dealt wonâ€™t trigger. It also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.
120.9. If an ability triggers on damage being dealt by a specific source or sources, and the effect refers to the â€œdamage dealt,â€� it refers only to the damage dealt by the specified sources and not to any damage dealt at the same time by other sources.
120.10. Some triggered abilities check whether a permanent has been dealt excess damage. These abilities check after the permanent has been dealt damage by one or more sources. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a creature greater than lethal damage, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that creature. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a planeswalker greater than that planeswalkerâ€™s loyalty before the damage was dealt, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that planeswalker. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a battle greater than that battleâ€™s defense before the damage was dealt, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that battle. If a permanent has multiple card types from among the list of creature, planeswalker, and battle, the excess damage dealt to that permanent is the greatest of the calculated amounts for each of the card types it has.
121.1. A player draws a card by putting the top card of their library into their hand. This is done as a turn-based action during each playerâ€™s draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell or ability.
121.2. Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.
121.3. If there are no cards in a playerâ€™s library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player canâ€™t draw cards and another effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player canâ€™t choose to do so.
121.4. A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
121.5. If an effect moves cards from a playerâ€™s library to that playerâ€™s hand without using the word â€œdraw,â€� the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and effects that replace card draws, as well as if the playerâ€™s library is empty.
121.6. Some effects replace card draws.
121.7. Some replacement effects and prevention effects result in one or more card draws. In such a case, if there are any parts of the original event that havenâ€™t been replaced, those parts occur first, then the card draws happen one at a time.
121.8. If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell is being cast, the drawn card is kept face down until that spell becomes cast (see rule 601.2i) or until the casting process is reversed (see rule 732, â€œHandling Illegal Actionsâ€�). The same is true with relation to another ability being activated. If an effect allows or instructs a player to reveal the card as itâ€™s being drawn, itâ€™s revealed after the spell becomes cast or the ability becomes activated. While face down, the drawn card is considered to have no characteristics and canâ€™t be used to pay any part of the cost of the spell or ability that would require the card to have specific characteristics.
121.9. If an effect gives a player the option to reveal a card as they draw it, that player may look at that card as they draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.
122.1. A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Counters are not objects and have no characteristics. Notably, a counter is not a token, and a token is not a counter. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable.
122.2. Counters on an object are not retained if that object moves from one zone to another. The counters are not â€œremovedâ€�; they simply cease to exist. See rule 400.7.
122.3. If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it as a state-based action, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it. See rule 704.
122.4. If a permanent with an ability that says it canâ€™t have more than N counters of a certain kind on it has more than N counters of that kind on it, all but N of those counters are removed from it as a state-based action. See rule 704.
122.5. If an effect says to â€œmoveâ€� a counter, it means to remove that counter from the object itâ€™s currently on and put it onto a second object. If either of these actions isnâ€™t possible, itâ€™s not possible to move a counter, and no counter is removed from or put onto anything. This may occur if the first and second objects are the same object; if the first object doesnâ€™t have the appropriate kind of counter on it; if the second object canâ€™t have counters put onto it; or if either object is no longer in the correct zone.
122.6. Some spells and abilities refer to counters being put on an object. This refers to putting counters on that object while itâ€™s on the battlefield and also to an object thatâ€™s given counters as it enters the battlefield.
122.7. An ability that triggers â€œWhen/Whenever the Nth [kind] counterâ€� is put on an object triggers when one or more counters of the appropriate kind are put on the object such that the object had fewer than N counters on it before the counters were put on it and N or more counters on it after.
122.8. If a triggered ability instructs a player to put one objectâ€™s counters on another object and that abilityâ€™s trigger condition or effect checks that the object with those counters left the battlefield, the player doesnâ€™t move counters from one object to the other. Rather, the player puts the same number of each kind of counter the first object had onto the second object. If the ability specifies what kind(s) of counters to place, the player puts the same number of each of those kinds of counter the first object had onto the second object.
122.9. If an activated ability of an object instructs a player to put its counters on another object and sacrificing the object with those counters is a cost to activate that ability, the player doesnâ€™t move counters from one object to the other. Rather, the player puts the same number of each kind of counter the first object had onto the second object. If the ability specified what kind(s) of counters to place, the player puts the same number of each of those kinds of counters the first object had onto the second object.
123.1. A sticker is a marker placed on an object that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Stickers are not objects. Notably, a sticker is not a counter or a token. Changes to an object from stickers are not part of its copiable values. There are four kinds of stickers: name stickers; ability stickers; power and toughness stickers; and art stickers.
123.2. Stickers are found in boosters of the Unfinity expansion on numbered inserts. Each insert has a predetermined combination of stickers. Any rule that refers to a sticker sheet refers to the specific combination of stickers found on one of those inserts. Sticker sheets are not cards and have no characteristics. Each sticker sheet can be found at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
123.3. If an effect instructs a player to put a sticker on an object, that player chooses a sticker that is not currently on any objects they own from among the stickers they have access to and puts it on that object.
123.4. Some rules and effects refer to a â€œstickeredâ€� object. An object is â€œstickeredâ€� if it currently has any kind of sticker on it. An object without any stickers on it is not a stickered object, even if it previously had stickers on it.
123.5. Stickers on an object are not retained as that object moves to a hidden zone. Stickers are retained as that object moves to a public zone and continue to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone; this is an exception to rule 400.7.
123.6. A name sticker consists only of one or more words. A name sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes the word on that sticker to be added to the text of that objectâ€™s name. This is a text-changing effect. See rule 613.1c and rule 612, â€œText-Changing Effects.â€�
123.7. An ability sticker is a sticker with one or more abilities printed on it. An ability sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes that object to gain the ability that is printed on that sticker. See rule 613.1f.
123.8. A power and toughness sticker is a sticker that has two numbers and a slash printed on it, resembling the power and toughness of a creature card. A power and toughness sticker on a creature or on a creature or Vehicle card in a zone other than the battlefield sets that objectâ€™s power and toughness to the values printed on that sticker (see rule 613.4b). If more than one power and toughness sticker is on a creature, use timestamp order to determine which one takes precedence (see rule 613.7).
123.9. An art sticker on a permanent has no effect on game play other than to act as a marker that other spells and abilities can identify.
200.1. The parts of a card are name, mana cost, illustration, color indicator, type line, expansion symbol, text box, power and toughness, loyalty, defense, hand modifier, life modifier, illustration credit, legal text, and collector number. Some cards may have more than one of any or all of these parts.
200.2. Some parts of a card are also characteristics of the object that has them. See rule 109.3.
200.3. Some objects that arenâ€™t cards (tokens, copies of cards, and copies of spells) have some of the parts of a card, but only the ones that are also characteristics. See rule 111 and rule 707.
201.1. The name of a card is printed on its upper left corner.
201.2. A cardâ€™s name is always considered to be the English version of its name, regardless of printed language.
201.3. Some cards with different English names are treated as though they had the same English name. Pairs of cards with this property have names that are interchangeable.
201.4. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player must choose the name of a card in the Oracle card reference. (See rule 108.1.) A player may not choose the name of a token unless itâ€™s also the name of a card.
201.5. Text that refers to the object itâ€™s on by name means just that particular object and not any other objects with that name, regardless of any name changes caused by game effects.
201.6. Promotional or alternate-art versions of some cards feature a secondary title bar below the name line. The cardâ€™s name as listed in the Oracle card reference is displayed in the secondary title bar, and an alternate name appears in the upper left corner. For the purposes of deck construction, game rules, and effects, these cards have only the card name specified in the secondary title bar. Rules text may also refer to a cardâ€™s alternate name; instances of the alternate name that are present in rules text refer to the name specified in the secondary title bar. The alternate name has no effect on game play.
202.1. A cardâ€™s mana cost is indicated by mana symbols near the top of the card. (See rule 107.4.) On most cards, these symbols are printed in the upper right corner. Some cards from the Future Sight set have alternate frames in which the mana symbols appear to the left of the illustration.
202.2. An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame.
202.3. The mana value of an object is a number equal to the total amount of mana in its mana cost, regardless of color.
202.4. Any additional cost listed in an objectâ€™s rules text or imposed by an effect isnâ€™t part of the mana cost. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�) Such costs are paid at the same time as the spellâ€™s other costs.
203.1. The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no effect on game play. For example, a creature doesnâ€™t have the flying ability unless stated in its rules text, even if itâ€™s depicted as flying.
204.1. The color indicator is printed to the left of the type line directly below the illustration. It consists of a circular symbol filled in with one or more colors. A color indicator is usually found on nonland cards without a mana cost.
204.2. An object with a color indicator is each color denoted by that color indicator.
205.1. The type line is printed directly below the illustration. It contains the cardâ€™s card type(s). It also contains the cardâ€™s subtype(s) and supertype(s), if applicable.
205.2. Card Types
205.3. Subtypes
205.4. Supertypes
206.1. The expansion symbol indicates which Magic set a card is from. Itâ€™s a small icon normally printed below the right edge of the illustration. It has no effect on game play.
206.2. The color of the expansion symbol indicates the rarity of the card within its set. A red-orange symbol indicates the card is mythic rare. A gold symbol indicates the card is rare. A silver symbol indicates the card is uncommon. A black or white symbol indicates the card is common or is a basic land. A purple symbol signifies a special rarity; to date, only the Time Spiralâ„¢ â€œtimeshiftedâ€� cards, which were rarer than that setâ€™s rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols. (Prior to the Exodusâ„¢ set, all expansion symbols were black, regardless of rarity. Also, prior to the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Simplified Chinese Fifth Edition core set, Magic core sets didnâ€™t have expansion symbols at all.)
206.3. Previously, a spell or ability that affected cards from a particular set checked for that setâ€™s expansion symbol. These cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to say they affect cards â€œwith a name originally printedâ€� in a particular set.
206.4. Players may include cards from any printing in their constructed decks if those cards appear in sets allowed in that format (or those cards are specifically allowed by the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules). See the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for the current definitions of the constructed formats (WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents).
206.5. The full list of expansions and expansion symbols can be found in the Card Set Archive section of the Magic website (Magic.Wizards.com/en/products/card-set-archive).
207.1. The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usually contains rules text defining the cardâ€™s abilities.
207.2. The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game function.
207.3. Some cards have decorative icons in the background of their text boxes. For example, a guild icon appears in the text box of many cards associated with the guilds of Ravnica, and a faction icon appears in the text box of most Scars of Mirrodinâ„¢ block cards. Similarly, many promotional cards include decorative icons. These icons have no effect on game play.
207.4. The chaos symbol appears in the text box of each plane card to the left of a triggered ability that triggers whenever chaos ensues. The symbol itself has no special rules meaning. See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�
207.5. One card (Cryptic Spires) has a set of symbols below the text box that represent each color and an ability that instructs a player to circle two of those colors as they create their deck. To circle a color, the player circles (or otherwise clearly indicates) that colorâ€™s symbol. The mana symbol of each circled color is considered part of that cardâ€™s printed rules text (see rule 613.1) and affects that cardâ€™s color identity (see rule 903.4).
208.1. A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed in its lower right corner. The first number is its power (the amount of damage it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of damage needed to destroy it). For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and toughness 3. Power and toughness can be modified or set to particular values by effects.
208.2. Rather than a fixed number, some creature cards have power and/or toughness that includes a star (*).
208.3. A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if itâ€™s a card with a power and toughness printed on it (such as a Vehicle). A noncreature object not on the battlefield has power or toughness only if it has a power and toughness printed on it.
208.4. Some effects refer to a creatureâ€™s â€œbase power,â€� â€œbase toughness,â€� or â€œbase power and toughness.â€�
208.5. If a creature somehow has no value for its power, its power is 0. The same is true for toughness.
209.1. Each planeswalker card has a loyalty number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its loyalty while itâ€™s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the planeswalker enters the battlefield with that many loyalty counters on it (see rule 306.5b).
209.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if none of that permanentâ€™s loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule 606, â€œLoyalty Abilities.â€�
210.1. Each battle card has a defense number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its defense while itâ€™s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the battle enters the battlefield with that many defense counters on it (see rule 310.4b).
211.1. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting hand size and the maximum hand size of the vanguard cardâ€™s owner are determined. See rule 103.5.
212.1. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total of the vanguard cardâ€™s owner is determined. See rule 103.4.
213.1. Each card features text printed below the text box that has no effect on game play. Not all card sets were printed with all of the information listed below on each card.
300.1. The card types are artifact, battle, conspiracy, creature, dungeon, enchantment, instant, kindred, land, phenomenon, plane, planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, and vanguard.
300.2. Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects combine the aspects of each of those card types, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or all of those card types.
301.1. A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting an artifact as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�)
301.2. When an artifact spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
301.3. Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: â€œArtifact â€” Equipment.â€� Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. Artifacts may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3g for the complete list of artifact types.
301.4. Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their card type. Most artifacts have no colored mana symbols in their mana costs, and are therefore colorless. However, there is no correlation between being colorless and being an artifact: artifacts may be colored, and colorless objects may be card types other than artifact.
301.5. Some artifacts have the subtype â€œEquipment.â€� An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It canâ€™t legally be attached to anything that isnâ€™t a creature.
301.6. Some artifacts have the subtype â€œFortification.â€� A Fortification can be attached to a land. It canâ€™t legally be attached to an object that isnâ€™t a land. Fortificationâ€™s analog to the equip keyword ability is the fortify keyword ability. Rules 301.5aâ€“f apply to Fortifications in relation to lands just as they apply to Equipment in relation to creatures, with one clarification relating to rule 301.5c: a Fortification thatâ€™s also a creature (not a land) canâ€™t fortify a land. (See rule 702.67, â€œFortify.â€�)
301.7. Some artifacts have the subtype â€œVehicle.â€� Most Vehicles have a crew ability which allows them to become artifact creatures. See rule 702.122, â€œCrew.â€�
302.1. A player who has priority may cast a creature card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting a creature as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�)
302.2. When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
302.3. Creature subtypes are usually a single word long and are listed after a long dash: â€œCreature â€” Human Soldier,â€� â€œArtifact Creature â€” Golem,â€� and so on. Creature subtypes are also called creature types. Creatures may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3m for the complete list of creature types.
302.4. Power and toughness are characteristics only creatures have.
302.5. Creatures can attack and block. (See rule 508, â€œDeclare Attackers Step,â€� and rule 509, â€œDeclare Blockers Step.â€�)
302.6. A creatureâ€™s activated ability with the tap symbol or the untap symbol in its activation cost canâ€™t be activated unless the creature has been under its controllerâ€™s control continuously since their most recent turn began. A creature canâ€™t attack unless it has been under its controllerâ€™s control continuously since their most recent turn began. This rule is informally called the â€œsummoning sicknessâ€� rule.
302.7. Damage dealt to a creature by a source with neither wither nor infect is marked on that creature (see rule 120.3). If the total damage marked on that creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule 704). All damage marked on a creature is removed when it regenerates (see rule 701.19, â€œRegenerateâ€�) and during the cleanup step (see rule 514.2).
303.1. A player who has priority may cast an enchantment card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting an enchantment as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�)
303.2. When an enchantment spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
303.3. Enchantment subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: â€œEnchantment â€” Shrine.â€� Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment types. Enchantments may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3h for the complete list of enchantment types.
303.4. Some enchantments have the subtype â€œAura.â€� An Aura enters the battlefield attached to an object or player. What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 702.5, â€œEnchantâ€�). Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.
303.5. Some enchantments have the subtype â€œSaga.â€� See rule 714 for more information about Saga cards.
303.6. Some enchantments have the subtype â€œClass.â€� See rule 716 for more information about Class cards.
303.7. Some Aura enchantments also have the subtype â€œRole.â€�
304.1. A player who has priority may cast an instant card from their hand. Casting an instant as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�)
304.2. When an instant spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then itâ€™s put into its ownerâ€™s graveyard.
304.3. Instant subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: â€œInstant â€” Arcane.â€� Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. The set of instant subtypes is the same as the set of sorcery subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. Instants may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3k for the complete list of spell types.
304.4. Instants canâ€™t enter the battlefield. If an instant would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone instead.
304.5. If text states that a player may do something â€œany time they could cast an instantâ€� or â€œonly as an instant,â€� it means only that the player must have priority. The player doesnâ€™t need to have an instant card they could cast. Effects that would preclude that player from casting an instant spell donâ€™t affect the playerâ€™s capability to perform that action (unless the action is actually casting an instant spell).
305.1. A player who has priority may play a land card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Playing a land is a special action; it doesnâ€™t use the stack (see rule 116). Rather, the player simply puts the land onto the battlefield. Since the land doesnâ€™t go on the stack, it is never a spell, and players canâ€™t respond to it with instants or activated abilities.
305.2. A player can normally play one land during their turn; however, continuous effects may increase this number.
305.3. A player canâ€™t play a land, for any reason, if it isnâ€™t their turn. Ignore any part of an effect that instructs a player to do so.
305.4. Effects may also allow players to â€œputâ€� lands onto the battlefield. This isnâ€™t the same as â€œplaying a landâ€� and doesnâ€™t count as a land played during the current turn.
305.5. Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash. Land subtypes are also called land types. Lands may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3i for the complete list of land types.
305.6. The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words â€œbasic land type,â€� itâ€™s referring to one of these subtypes. An object with the land card type and a basic land type has the intrinsic ability â€œ{T}: Add [mana symbol],â€� even if the text box doesnâ€™t actually contain that text or the object has no text box. For Plains, [mana symbol] is {W}; for Islands, {U}; for Swamps, {B}; for Mountains, {R}; and for Forests, {G}. See rule 107.4a. See also rule 605, â€œMana Abilities.â€�
305.7. If an effect sets a landâ€™s subtype to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text, its old land types, and any copiable effects affecting that land, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this doesnâ€™t remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Setting a landâ€™s subtype doesnâ€™t add or remove any card types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.
305.8. Any land with the supertype â€œbasicâ€� is a basic land. Any land that doesnâ€™t have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.
305.9. If an object is both a land and another card type, it can be played only as a land. It canâ€™t be cast as a spell.
306.1. A player who has priority may cast a planeswalker card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting a planeswalker as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�)
306.2. When a planeswalker spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
306.3. Planeswalker subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: â€œPlaneswalker â€” Jace.â€� Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Planeswalker subtypes are also called planeswalker types. Planeswalkers may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3j for the complete list of planeswalker types.
306.4. Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a â€œplaneswalker uniqueness ruleâ€� that stopped a player from controlling two planeswalkers of the same planeswalker type. This rule has been removed and planeswalker cards printed before this change have received errata in the Oracle card reference to have the legendary supertype. Like other legendary permanents, they are subject to the â€œlegend ruleâ€� (see rule 704.5j).
306.5. Loyalty is a characteristic only planeswalkers have.
306.6. Planeswalkers can be attacked. (See rule 508, â€œDeclare Attackers Step.â€�)
306.7. Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a redirection effect that allowed a player to have noncombat damage that would be dealt to an opponent be dealt to a planeswalker under that opponentâ€™s control instead. This rule has been removed and certain cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to deal damage directly to planeswalkers.
306.8. Damage dealt to a planeswalker results in that many loyalty counters being removed from it.
306.9. If a planeswalkerâ€™s loyalty is 0, itâ€™s put into its ownerâ€™s graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
307.1. A player who has priority may cast a sorcery card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting a sorcery as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�)
307.2. When a sorcery spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then itâ€™s put into its ownerâ€™s graveyard.
307.3. Sorcery subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: â€œSorcery â€” Arcane.â€� Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. The set of sorcery subtypes is the same as the set of instant subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. Sorceries may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3k for the complete list of spell types.
307.4. Sorceries canâ€™t enter the battlefield. If a sorcery would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone instead.
307.5. If a spell, ability, or effect states that a player can do something only â€œany time they could cast a sorceryâ€� or â€œonly as a sorcery,â€� it means only that the player must have priority, it must be during the main phase of their turn, and the stack must be empty. The player doesnâ€™t need to have a sorcery card they could cast. Effects that would preclude that player from casting a sorcery spell donâ€™t affect the playerâ€™s capability to perform that action (unless the action is actually casting a sorcery spell).
308.1. Each kindred card has another card type. Casting and resolving a kindred card follows the rules for casting and resolving a card of the other card type.
308.2. Kindred subtypes are usually a single word long and are listed after a long dash: â€œKindred Enchantment â€” Merfolk.â€� The set of kindred subtypes is the same as the set of creature subtypes; these subtypes are called creature types. Kindreds may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3m for the complete list of creature types.
308.3. Some older kindred cards were printed with the â€œtribalâ€� card type. Cards printed with that type have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
309.1. Dungeon is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards.
309.2. Dungeon cards begin outside the game. Dungeon cards arenâ€™t part of a playerâ€™s deck or sideboard. They are brought into the game using the venture into the dungeon keyword action. See rule 701.49, â€œVenture into the Dungeon.â€�
309.3. A player can own only one dungeon card in the command zone at a time, and they canâ€™t bring a dungeon card into the game if a dungeon card they own is in the command zone.
309.4. Each dungeon card has a series of rooms connected to one another with arrows. A player uses a venture marker placed on the dungeon card they own to indicate which room they are currently in.
309.5. The venture into the dungeon keyword action allows players to move their venture marker down the rooms of a dungeon card.
309.6. If a playerâ€™s venture marker is on the bottommost room of a dungeon card, and that dungeon card isnâ€™t the source of a room ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the dungeon cardâ€™s owner removes it from the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
309.7. A player completes a dungeon as that dungeon card is removed from the game.
310.1. A player who has priority may cast a battle card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting a battle as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�)
310.2. When a battle spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
310.3. Battle subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: â€œBattle â€” Siege.â€� Battle subtypes are also called battle types. See rule 205.3q for the complete list of battle types.
310.4. Defense is a characteristic that battles have.
310.5. Battles can be attacked. (See rule 508, â€œDeclare Attackers Step.â€�)
310.6. Damage dealt to a battle results in that many defense counters being removed from it.
310.7. If a battleâ€™s defense is 0 and it isnâ€™t the source of an ability which has triggered but not yet left the stack, itâ€™s put into its ownerâ€™s graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
310.8. Each battle has a player designated as its protector.
310.9. A battle canâ€™t be attached to players or permanents, even if it is also an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification. If a battle is somehow attached to a permanent, it becomes unattached. This is a state-based action (see rule 704).
310.10. If a battle that isnâ€™t being attacked has no player designated as its protector, or its protector is a player who canâ€™t be its protector based on its battle type, its controller chooses an appropriate player to be its protector. If no player can be chosen this way, the battle is put into its ownerâ€™s graveyard. This is a state-based action (see rule 704).
310.11. All currently existing battles have the subtype Siege. Sieges are subject to special rules.
311.1. Plane is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant uses plane cards. See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�
311.2. Plane cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâ€™re part of a planar deck and while theyâ€™re face up. Theyâ€™re not permanents. They canâ€™t be cast. If a plane card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
311.3. Plane subtypes are listed after a long dash, and may be multiple words: â€œPlane â€” Serraâ€™s Realm.â€� All words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype. Planar subtypes are called planar types. A plane can have only one subtype. See rule 205.3n for the complete list of planar types.
311.4. A plane card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a plane card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
311.5. The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldnâ€™t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
311.6. A face-up plane card thatâ€™s turned face down becomes a new object.
311.7. Each plane card has a triggered ability that triggers â€œWhenever chaos ensues.â€� These are called chaos abilities. Each one is indicated by a chaos symbol to the left of the ability, though the symbol itself has no special rules meaning. This ability triggers if the chaos symbol is rolled on the planar die (see rule 901.9b), if a resolving spell or ability says that chaos ensues, or if a resolving spell or ability states that chaos ensues for a particular object. In the last case, the chaos ability can trigger even if that plane card is still in the planar deck but revealed. A chaos ability is controlled by the current planar controller.
312.1. Phenomenon is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant uses phenomenon cards. See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�
312.2. Phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâ€™re part of a planar deck and while theyâ€™re face up. Theyâ€™re not permanents. They canâ€™t be cast. If a phenomenon card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
312.3. Phenomenon cards have no subtypes.
312.4. The controller of a face-up phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldnâ€™t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
312.5. Each phenomenon card has a triggered ability that triggers when you encounter it. â€œWhen you encounter [this phenomenon]â€� means â€œWhen you move this card off a planar deck and turn it face up.â€�
312.6. A face-up phenomenon card thatâ€™s turned face down becomes a new object.
312.7. If a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isnâ€™t the source of a triggered ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action; see rule 704. See also rule 701.31, â€œPlaneswalk.â€�)
313.1. Vanguard is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Vanguard casual variant uses vanguard cards. See rule 902, â€œVanguard.â€�
313.2. Vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. Theyâ€™re not permanents. They canâ€™t be cast. If a vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
313.3. Vanguard cards have no subtypes.
313.4. A vanguard card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a vanguard card is in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
313.5. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.
313.6. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied to the starting hand size and maximum hand size of the vanguard cardâ€™s owner (normally seven). The resulting number is both how many cards that player draws at the beginning of the game and their maximum hand size. See rule 103.5.
313.7. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total of the vanguard cardâ€™s owner (normally 20) to is determined. See rule 103.4.
314.1. Scheme is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Archenemy casual variant uses scheme cards. See rule 904, â€œArchenemy.â€�
314.2. Scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâ€™re part of a scheme deck and while theyâ€™re face up. Theyâ€™re not permanents. They canâ€™t be cast. If a scheme card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
314.3. Scheme cards have no subtypes.
314.4. A scheme card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a scheme card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
314.5. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.
314.6. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its ownerâ€™s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
314.7. If an ability of a scheme card includes the text â€œthis scheme,â€� it means the scheme card in the command zone thatâ€™s the source of that ability. This is an exception to rule 109.2.
315.1. Conspiracy cards are used only in limited play, particularly in the Conspiracy Draft variant (see rule 905). Conspiracy cards arenâ€™t used in constructed play.
315.2. At the start of a game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone. Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. (See rule 702.106, â€œHidden Agenda.â€�)
315.3. Conspiracy cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. Theyâ€™re not permanents. They canâ€™t be cast or included in a deck. If a conspiracy card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone. Conspiracy cards that arenâ€™t in the game canâ€™t be brought into the game.
315.4. Conspiracy cards have no subtypes.
315.5. Conspiracy cards may have any number of static or triggered abilities. As long as a conspiracy card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, and its triggered abilities may trigger.
315.6. The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.
315.7. At any time, you may look at a face-down conspiracy card you control. You canâ€™t look at face-down conspiracy cards controlled by other players.
400.1. A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally seven zones: library, hand, battlefield, graveyard, stack, exile, and command. Some older cards also use the ante zone. Each player has their own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.
400.2. Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cardsâ€™ faces, except for those cards that some rule or effect specifically allow to be face down. Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command are public zones. Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be expected to see the cardsâ€™ faces. Library and hand are hidden zones, even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.
400.3. If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its ownerâ€™s, it goes to its ownerâ€™s corresponding zone.
400.4. Cards with certain card types canâ€™t enter certain zones.
400.5. The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack canâ€™t be changed except when effects or rules allow it. The same is true for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones. Other objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether theyâ€™re tapped or flipped, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.
400.6. If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what event is moving the object. If the object is moving to a public zone and its owner will be able to look at it in that zone, its owner looks at it to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. If the object is moving to the battlefield, each other player who will be able to look at it in that zone does so. Then any appropriate replacement effects, whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that objectâ€™s controllerâ€”or its owner if it has no controllerâ€”chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does. (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous â€œdestroyâ€� effects.) Then the event moves the object.
400.7. An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to, its previous existence. This rule has the following exceptions.
400.8. If an object in the exile zone is exiled, it doesnâ€™t change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.
400.9. If a face-up object in the command zone is turned face down, it becomes a new object.
400.10. If an object in the command zone is put into the command zone, it doesnâ€™t change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just entered the command zone.
400.11. An object is outside the game if it isnâ€™t in any of the gameâ€™s zones. Outside the game is not a zone.
400.12. Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone (such as â€œShuffle your hand into your libraryâ€�). That action is performed on all cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected.
401.1. When a game begins, each playerâ€™s deck becomes their library.
401.2. Each library must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players canâ€™t look at or change the order of cards in a library.
401.3. Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any playerâ€™s library at any time.
401.4. If an effect puts two or more cards in a specific position in a library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That libraryâ€™s owner doesnâ€™t reveal the order in which the cards go into the library.
401.5. Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, or say that a player may look at the top card of their library. If the top card of the playerâ€™s library changes while a spell is being cast, the new top card wonâ€™t be revealed and canâ€™t be looked at until the spell becomes cast (see rule 601.2i). The same is true with relation to an ability being activated. If the top card of the playerâ€™s library changes while a player is taking a special action (see rule 116, â€œSpecial Actionsâ€�), the new card wonâ€™t be revealed and canâ€™t be looked at until the player has finished taking that special action.
401.6. If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, and that particular card stops being revealed for any length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.
401.7. If an effect causes a player to put a card into a library â€œNth from the top,â€� and that library has fewer than N cards in it, the player puts that card on the bottom of that library.
402.1. The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a playerâ€™s hand by other effects as well. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a number of cards equal to that playerâ€™s starting hand size, normally seven. (See rule 103, â€œStarting the Game.â€�)
402.2. Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of cards in their hand, but as part of their cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the maximum hand size.
402.3. A player may arrange their hand in any convenient fashion and look at it at any time. A player canâ€™t look at the cards in another playerâ€™s hand but may count those cards at any time.
403.1. Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield. The battlefield starts out empty. Permanents a player controls are normally kept in front of them on the battlefield, though there are some cases (such as an Aura attached to another playerâ€™s permanent) when a permanent one player controls is kept closer to a different player.
403.2. A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it specifically mentions a player or another zone.
403.3. Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Every object on the battlefield is a permanent. See rule 110, â€œPermanents.â€�
403.4. Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object and has no relationship to any previous permanent represented by the same card, except for the cases listed in rule 400.7. (This is also true for any objects entering any zone.)
403.5. Previously, the battlefield was called the â€œin-play zone.â€� Cards that were printed with text that contains the phrases â€œin play,â€� â€œfrom play,â€� â€œinto play,â€� or the like are referring to the battlefield. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
404.1. A playerâ€™s graveyard is their discard pile. Any object thatâ€™s countered, discarded, destroyed, or sacrificed is put on top of its ownerâ€™s graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell thatâ€™s finished resolving. Each playerâ€™s graveyard starts out empty.
404.2. Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at any time but normally canâ€™t change their order. Additional rules applying to sanctioned tournaments may allow a player to change the order of cards in their graveyard.
404.3. If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
405.1. When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see rule 601.2a). When an ability is activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules 602.2a and 603.3).
405.2. The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object is put on the stack, itâ€™s put on top of all objects already there.
405.3. If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time, those controlled by the active player are put on lowest, followed by each other playerâ€™s objects in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). If a player controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order on the stack.
405.4. Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered ability thatâ€™s on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The controller of a spell is the person who cast it. The controller of an activated ability is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the abilityâ€™s source when it triggered, unless itâ€™s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7dâ€“f.
405.5. When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.
405.6. Some things that happen during the game donâ€™t use the stack.
406.1. The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells and abilities exile an object without any way to return that object to another zone. Other spells and abilities exile an object only temporarily.
406.2. To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone itâ€™s currently in. An exiled card is a card thatâ€™s been put into the exile zone.
406.3. Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards â€œexiled face downâ€� canâ€™t be examined by any player except when instructions allow it. However, if a player is instructed to look at a card and then exile it face down, or once a player is allowed to look at a card exiled face down, that player may continue to look at that card until it leaves the exile zone or is part of a pile of cards that are shuffled, even if the instruction allowing the player to do so no longer applies.
406.4. Face-down cards in exile should be kept in separate piles based on when they were exiled and how they were exiled. If a player is instructed to choose an exiled card, the player may choose a specific face-down card only if the player is allowed to look at that card. Otherwise, they may choose a pile of face-down exiled cards, and then a card is chosen at random from within that pile. If choosing such a card is part of casting a spell or activating an ability, the chosen card isnâ€™t revealed until after that cost is fully paid. (See rule 601.2i.)
406.5. Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone should be kept in separate piles to keep track of their respective ways of returning. Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to their own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards that exiled them should likewise be kept in separate piles.
406.6. An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to â€œthe exiled cardsâ€� or to cards â€œexiled with [this object].â€� These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the first. See rule 607, â€œLinked Abilities.â€�
406.7. If an object in the exile zone becomes exiled, it doesnâ€™t change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.
406.8. Previously, the exile zone was called the â€œremoved-from-the-game zone.â€� Cards that were printed with text that â€œremoves [an object] from the gameâ€� exiles that object. The same is true for cards printed with text that â€œsets [an object] aside.â€� Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
407.1. Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way of playing â€œfor keeps.â€� Playing Magic games for ante is now considered an optional variation on the game, and itâ€™s allowed only where itâ€™s not forbidden by law or by other rules. Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents).
407.2. When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from their deck into the ante zone after determining which player goes first but before players draw any cards. Cards in the ante zone may be examined by any player at any time. At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of all the cards in the ante zone.
407.3. A few cards have the text â€œRemove this card from your deck before playing if youâ€™re not playing for ante.â€� These are the only cards that can add or remove cards from the ante zone or change a cardâ€™s owner. When not playing for ante, players canâ€™t include these cards in their decks or sideboards, and these cards canâ€™t be brought into the game from outside the game.
407.4. To ante an object is to put that object into the ante zone from whichever zone itâ€™s currently in. The owner of an object is the only person who can ante that object.
408.1. The command zone is a game area reserved for certain specialized objects that have an overarching effect on the game, yet are not permanents and cannot be destroyed.
408.2. Emblems may be created in the command zone. See rule 114, â€œEmblems.â€�
408.3. In the Planechase, Vanguard, Commander, Archenemy, and Conspiracy Draft casual variants, nontraditional Magic cards and/or specially designated cards start the game in the command zone. Each variant has its own rules regarding such cards. See section 9, â€œCasual Variants.â€�
500.1. A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat main, combat, postcombat main, and ending. Each of these phases takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase. The beginning, combat, and ending phases are further broken down into steps, which proceed in order.
500.2. A phase or step in which players receive priority ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession. Simply having the stack become empty doesnâ€™t cause such a phase or step to end; all players have to pass in succession with the stack empty. Because of this, each player gets a chance to add new things to the stack before that phase or step ends.
500.3. A step in which no players receive priority ends when all specified actions that take place during that step are completed. The only such steps are the untap step (see rule 502) and certain cleanup steps (see rule 514).
500.4. When a step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a playerâ€™s mana pool empties. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
500.5. When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last â€œuntil end ofâ€� that phase or step expire. When a phase or step begins, any effects scheduled to last â€œuntilâ€� that phase or step expire. Effects that last â€œuntil end of combatâ€� expire at the end of the combat phase, not at the beginning of the end of combat step. Effects that last â€œuntil end of turnâ€� are subject to special rules; see rule 514.2.
500.6. When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger â€œat the beginning ofâ€� that phase or step trigger. They are put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
500.7. Some effects can give a player extra turns. They do this by adding the turns directly after the specified turn. If a player is given multiple extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time. If multiple players are given extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time, in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). The most recently created turn will be taken first.
500.8. Some effects can add phases to a turn. They do this by adding the phases directly after the specified phase. If multiple extra phases are created after the same phase, the most recently created phase will occur first.
500.9. Some effects can add steps to a phase. They do this by adding the steps directly after a specified step or directly before a specified step. If multiple extra steps are created after the same step, the most recently created step will occur first.
500.10. Some effects add a step after a particular phase. In that case, that effect first creates the phase which normally contains that step directly after the specified phase. Any other steps that phase would normally have are skipped (see rule 500.11).
500.11. Some effects can cause a step, phase, or turn to be skipped. To skip a step, phase, or turn is to proceed past it as though it didnâ€™t exist. See rule 614.10.
500.12. No game events can occur between steps, phases, or turns.
501.1. The beginning phase consists of three steps, in this order: untap, upkeep, and draw.
502.1. First, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase in. This all happens simultaneously. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. See rule 702.26, â€œPhasing.â€�
502.2. Second, if itâ€™s day and the previous turnâ€™s active player didnâ€™t cast any spells during that turn, it becomes night. If itâ€™s night and the previous turnâ€™s active player cast two or more spells during that turn, it becomes day. If itâ€™s neither day nor night, this check doesnâ€™t happen and it remains neither. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. See rule 730, â€œDay and Night.â€�
502.3. Third, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them all simultaneously. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. Normally, all of a playerâ€™s permanents untap, but effects can keep one or more of a playerâ€™s permanents from untapping.
502.4. No player receives priority during the untap step, so no spells can be cast or resolve and no abilities can be activated or resolve. Any ability that triggers during this step will be held until the next time a player would receive priority, which is usually during the upkeep step. (See rule 503, â€œUpkeep Step.â€�)
503.1. The upkeep step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
503.2. If a spell states that it may be cast only â€œafter [a playerâ€™s] upkeep step,â€� and the turn has multiple upkeep steps, that spell may be cast any time after the first upkeep step ends.
504.1. First, the active player draws a card. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
504.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
505.1. There are two main phases in a turn. In each turn, the first main phase (also known as the precombat main phase) and the second main phase (also known as the postcombat main phase) are separated by the combat phase (see rule 506, â€œCombat Phaseâ€�). The precombat and postcombat main phases are individually and collectively known as the main phase.
505.2. The main phase has no steps, so a main phase ends when all players pass in succession while the stack is empty. (See rule 500.2.)
505.3. First, but only if the players are playing an Archenemy game (see rule 904), the active player is the archenemy, and itâ€™s the active playerâ€™s precombat main phase, the active player sets the top card of their scheme deck in motion (see rule 701.32). This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
505.4. Second, if the active player controls one or more Saga enchantments and itâ€™s the active playerâ€™s precombat main phase, the active player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control with one or more chapter abilities. (See rule 714, â€œSaga Cards.â€�) This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
505.5. Third, if the active player controls one or more Attractions and itâ€™s the active playerâ€™s precombat main phase, the active player rolls to visit their Attractions. (See rule 701.52, â€œRoll to Visit Your Attractions.â€�) This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
505.6. Fourth, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
506.1. The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat. The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped if no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking (see rule 508.8). There are two combat damage steps if any attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike (see rule 702.4).
506.2. During the combat phase, the active player is the attacking player; creatures that player controls may attack. During the combat phase of a two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that player, planeswalkers they control, and battles they protect may be attacked.
506.3. Only a creature can attack or block. Only a player, a planeswalker, or a battle can be attacked.
506.4. A permanent is removed from combat if it leaves the battlefield, if its controller changes, if it phases out, if an effect specifically removes it from combat, if itâ€™s a planeswalker thatâ€™s being attacked and stops being a planeswalker, if itâ€™s a battle thatâ€™s being attacked and stops being a battle, or if itâ€™s an attacking or blocking creature that regenerates (see rule 701.19), stops being a creature, or becomes a battle. A creature thatâ€™s removed from combat stops being an attacking, blocking, blocked, and/or unblocked creature. A planeswalker or battle thatâ€™s removed from combat stops being attacked.
506.5. A creature attacks alone if itâ€™s the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step. A creature is attacking alone if itâ€™s attacking but no other creatures are. A creature blocks alone if itâ€™s the only creature declared as a blocker during the declare blockers step. A creature is blocking alone if itâ€™s blocking but no other creatures are.
506.6. Some abilities check to see whether or not a creature â€œhad to attackâ€� during a particular combat phase. A creature had to attack if one or more effects were requiring that creature to attack at the time attackers were declared in that combat. A creature did not â€œhave to attackâ€� if there were no such effects that required it to attack, even if there were no other legal attacks that could have been declared. (See rule 508.)
506.7. Some spells state that they may be cast â€œonly [before/after] [a particular point in the combat phase],â€� in which that point may be â€œattackers are declared,â€� â€œblockers are declared,â€� â€œthe combat damage step,â€� â€œthe end of combat step,â€� â€œthe combat phase,â€� or â€œcombat.â€�
507.1. First, if the game being played is a multiplayer game in which the active playerâ€™s opponents donâ€™t all automatically become defending players, the active player chooses one of their opponents. That player becomes the defending player. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. (See rule 506.2.)
507.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
508.1. First, the active player declares attackers. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. To declare attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 732, â€œHandling Illegal Actionsâ€�).
508.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
508.3. Triggered abilities that trigger on attackers being declared may have different trigger conditions.
508.4. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller chooses which defending player, planeswalker a defending player controls, or battle a defending player protects itâ€™s attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what itâ€™s attacking). Similarly, if an effect states that a creature is attacking, its controller chooses which defending player, planeswalker a defending player controls, or battle a defending player protects itâ€™s attacking (unless the effect has already specified). Such creatures are â€œattackingâ€� but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, they never â€œattacked.â€�
508.5. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player itâ€™s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player itâ€™s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat.
508.6. A player is â€œattacking [a player]â€� if the first player controls a creature that is attacking the second player. A player has â€œattacked [a player]â€� if the first player declared one or more creatures as attackers attacking the second player.
508.7. Some cards allow a player to reselect which player, planeswalker, or battle a creature is attacking.
508.8. If no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking, skip the declare blockers and combat damage steps.
509.1. First, the defending player declares blockers. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. To declare blockers, the defending player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 732, â€œHandling Illegal Actionsâ€�).
509.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
509.3. Triggered abilities that trigger on blockers being declared may have different trigger conditions.
509.4. If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller chooses which attacking creature itâ€™s blocking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what itâ€™s blocking). A creature put onto the battlefield this way is â€œblockingâ€� but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, it never â€œblocked.â€�
510.1. First, the active player announces how each attacking creature assigns its combat damage, then the defending player announces how each blocking creature assigns its combat damage. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. A player assigns a creatureâ€™s combat damage according to the following rules:
510.2. Second, all combat damage thatâ€™s been assigned is dealt simultaneously. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. No player has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time combat damage is assigned and the time itâ€™s dealt.
510.3. Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
510.4. If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike (see rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.
511.1. The end of combat step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
511.2. Abilities that trigger â€œat end of combatâ€� trigger as the end of combat step begins. Effects that last â€œuntil end of combatâ€� expire at the end of the combat phase.
511.3. As soon as the end of combat step ends, all creatures, battles, and planeswalkers are removed from combat. After the end of combat step ends, the combat phase is over and the postcombat main phase begins (see rule 505).
512.1. The ending phase consists of two steps: end and cleanup.
513.1. The end step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€�)
513.2. If a permanent with an ability that triggers â€œat the beginning of the end stepâ€� enters the battlefield during this step, that ability wonâ€™t trigger until the next turnâ€™s end step. Likewise, if a delayed triggered ability that triggers â€œat the beginning of the next end stepâ€� is created during this step, that ability wonâ€™t trigger until the next turnâ€™s end step. In other words, the step doesnâ€™t â€œback upâ€� so those abilities can go on the stack. This rule applies only to triggered abilities; it doesnâ€™t apply to continuous effects whose durations say â€œuntil end of turnâ€� or â€œthis turn.â€� (See rule 514, â€œCleanup Step.â€�)
514.1. First, if the active playerâ€™s hand contains more cards than their maximum hand size (normally seven), they discard enough cards to reduce their hand size to that number. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
514.2. Second, the following actions happen simultaneously: all damage marked on permanents (including phased-out permanents) is removed and all â€œuntil end of turnâ€� and â€œthis turnâ€� effects end. This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
514.3. Normally, no player receives priority during the cleanup step, so no spells can be cast and no abilities can be activated. However, this rule is subject to the following exception:
601.1. Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as â€œplayingâ€� that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to â€œcastingâ€� that spell or that card.
601.2. To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell (rules 601.2aâ€“d) and determination and payment of costs (rules 601.2fâ€“h). To cast a spell, a player follows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process (see rule 601.3). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 732, â€œHandling Illegal Actionsâ€�).
601.3. A player can begin to cast a spell only if a rule or effect allows that player to cast it and no rule or effect prohibits that player from casting it.
601.4. While announcing the choices of any modes, alternative costs, and/or additional costs as described in rule 601.2b, some options may be available to a player only if other choices are made that would normally be made later in that ruleâ€™s instructions. In that case, the spellâ€™s controller may consider any other choices to be made in that step. If any such choices could allow them to choose a particular mode, alternative cost, or additional cost, they may do so.
601.5. If a player is no longer allowed to cast a spell after completing its proposal (see rules 601.2aâ€“d), the casting of the spell is illegal and the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 732, â€œHandling Illegal Actionsâ€�). It doesnâ€™t matter if a rule or effect would make the casting of the spell illegal while determining and paying that spellâ€™s costs (see rules 601.2fâ€“h) or any time after the spell has been cast.
601.6. Some spells specify that one of their controllerâ€™s opponents does something the controller would normally do while itâ€™s being cast, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the spellâ€™s controller normally would do so.
601.7. Casting a spell that alters costs wonâ€™t affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
602.1. Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as â€œ[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]â€�
602.2. To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an objectâ€™s controller (or its owner, if it doesnâ€™t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to be activated (see rule 732, â€œHandling Illegal Actionsâ€�). Announcements and payments canâ€™t be altered after theyâ€™ve been made.
602.3. Some abilities specify that one of their controllerâ€™s opponents does something the controller would normally do while itâ€™s being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the abilityâ€™s controller normally would do so.
602.4. Activating an ability that alters costs wonâ€™t affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
602.5. A player canâ€™t begin to activate an ability thatâ€™s prohibited from being activated.
603.1. Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as â€œ[When/Whenever/At] [trigger condition or event], [effect]. [Instructions (if any).]â€�
603.2. Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered abilityâ€™s trigger event, that ability automatically triggers. The ability doesnâ€™t do anything at this point.
603.3. Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object thatâ€™s not a card the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 117, â€œTiming and Priority.â€� The ability becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It remains on the stack until itâ€™s countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an effect moves it elsewhere.
603.4. A triggered ability may read â€œWhen/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].â€� When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isnâ€™t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the â€œintervening â€˜ifâ€™ clauseâ€� rule. (The word â€œifâ€� has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an â€œifâ€� that immediately follows a trigger condition.)
603.5. Some triggered abilitiesâ€™ effects are optional (they contain â€œmay,â€� as in â€œAt the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a cardâ€�). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the abilityâ€™s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves. Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect â€œunlessâ€� something is true or a player chooses to do something will go on the stack normally; the â€œunlessâ€� part of the ability is dealt with when the ability resolves.
603.6. Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called â€œzone-change triggers.â€� Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponentâ€™s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers.
603.7. An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered ability will contain â€œwhen,â€� â€œwhenever,â€� or â€œat,â€� although that word wonâ€™t usually begin the ability.
603.8. Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. Theyâ€™ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are called state triggers. (Note that state triggers arenâ€™t the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered ability doesnâ€™t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.
603.9. Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the result of a draw. See rule 104.3.
603.10. Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are exceptions to this rule; the game â€œlooks back in timeâ€� to determine if those abilities trigger, using the existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of exceptions is as follows:
603.11. Some objects have a static ability thatâ€™s linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule 607, â€œLinked Abilities.â€�) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by each triggered ability thatâ€™s linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.
603.12. A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered ability that triggers â€œwhen [a player] [does or doesnâ€™t]â€� take that action or â€œwhen [something happens] this way.â€� These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule 603.7), except that theyâ€™re checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.
604.1. Static abilities do something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written as statements, and theyâ€™re simply true.
604.2. Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone, as described in rule 113.6.
604.3. Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities. A characteristic-defining ability conveys information about an objectâ€™s characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that object (such as in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box). Characteristic-defining abilities can add to or override information found elsewhere on that object. Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones. They also function outside the game and before the game begins.
604.4. Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that modify the object theyâ€™re attached to, but those abilities donâ€™t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.
604.5. Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to countering the spell. Also, abilities that say â€œAs an additional cost to cast . . . ,â€� â€œYou may pay [cost] rather than pay [this object]â€™s mana cost,â€� and â€œYou may cast [this object] without paying its mana costâ€� work while a spell is on the stack.
604.6. Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could cast or play it from (usually your hand). These are limited to those that read, â€œYou may [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,â€� â€œYou canâ€™t [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,â€� and â€œ[Cast/Play] [this card] only . . . .â€�
604.7. Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities canâ€™t use an objectâ€™s last known information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied.
605.1. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities, which are subject to special rules. Only abilities that meet either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities, regardless of what other effects they may generate or what timing restrictions (such as â€œActivate only as an instantâ€�) they may have.
605.2. A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesnâ€™t allow it to produce mana.
605.3. Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for activating any other activated ability (see rule 602.2), with the following exceptions:
605.4. Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered abilities (see rule 603, â€œHandling Triggered Abilitiesâ€�), with the following exception:
605.5. Abilities that donâ€™t meet the criteria specified in rules 605.1aâ€“b and spells arenâ€™t mana abilities.
606.1. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities, which are subject to special rules.
606.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Normally, only planeswalkers have loyalty abilities.
606.3. A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn.
606.4. The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on or remove from that permanent a certain number of loyalty counters, as shown by the loyalty symbol in the abilityâ€™s cost. This cost may be modified by other effects.
606.6. A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost, taking into account any additional costs, canâ€™t be activated unless the permanent has at least that many loyalty counters on it.
607.1. An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them causes actions to be taken or objects or players to be affected and the other one directly refers to those actions, objects, or players. If so, these two abilities are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects or players that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.
607.2. There are different kinds of linked abilities.
607.3. If, within a pair of linked abilities, one ability refers to a single object as â€œthe exiled card,â€� â€œa card exiled with [this object],â€� or a similar phrase, and the other ability has exiled multiple cards (usually because it was copied), the ability refers to each of the exiled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the exiled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on â€œtheâ€� card, it performs that action on each exiled card. If that ability creates a token that is a copy of â€œtheâ€� card, then for each exiled card, it creates a token that is a copy of that card. If that ability performs any actions on â€œaâ€� card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.
607.4. An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.
607.5. If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same effect, the abilities will be similarly linked to one another on that object even though they werenâ€™t printed on that object. They canâ€™t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past.
608.1. Each time all players pass in succession, the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves. (See rule 609, â€œEffects.â€�)
608.2. If the object thatâ€™s resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules 608.2a and 608.2b are followed first. The steps described in rules 608.2câ€“m are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The steps described in rule 608.2n and 608.2p are followed last.
608.3. If the object thatâ€™s resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution may involve several steps. The instructions in rules 608.3a and b are always performed first. Then one of the steps in rule 608.3câ€“e is performed, if appropriate.
609.1. An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or ability. When a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.
609.2. Effects apply only to permanents unless the instructionâ€™s text states otherwise or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more other zones.
609.3. If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible.
609.4. Some effects state that a player may do something â€œas thoughâ€� some condition were true or a creature can do something â€œas thoughâ€� some condition were true. This applies only to the stated effect. For purposes of that effect, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition were true. For all other purposes, treat the game normally.
609.5. If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The Magic game has no default for ties.
609.6. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rules 614 and 615.
609.7. Some effects apply to damage from a sourceâ€”for example, â€œThe next time a red source of your choice would deal damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.â€�
610.1. A one-shot effect does something just once and doesnâ€™t have a duration. Examples include dealing damage, destroying a permanent, creating a token, and moving an object from one zone to another.
610.2. Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered ability, which instructs a player to do something later in the game (usually at a specific time) rather than as the spell or ability thatâ€™s creating the one-shot effect resolves. See rule 603.7.
610.3. Some one-shot effects cause an object to change zones â€œuntilâ€� a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect returns the object to its previous zone.
610.4. Some one-shot effects cause a permanent to phase out â€œuntilâ€� a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect causes the permanent to phase in.
611.1. A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects, modifies control of objects, or affects players or the rules of the game, for a fixed or indefinite period.
611.2. A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability.
611.3. A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an object.
612.1. Some continuous effects change an objectâ€™s text. This can apply to any words or symbols printed on that object, but generally affects only that objectâ€™s rules text (which appears in its text box) and/or the text that appears in its type line. Such an effect is a text-changing effect.
612.2. A text-changing effect changes only those words that are used in the correct way (for example, a Magic color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a creature type). An effect that changes a color word or a subtype canâ€™t change a card name, even if that name contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a Magic color word, basic land type, or creature type.
612.3. Effects that add or remove abilities donâ€™t change the text of the objects they affect, so any abilities that are granted to an object canâ€™t be modified by text-changing effects that affect that object.
612.4. A tokenâ€™s subtypes and rules text are defined by the spell or ability that created the token. A text-changing effect that affects a token can change these characteristics.
612.5. One card (Exchange of Words) instructs a player to exchange the text boxes of two objects. This replaces all of the rules text of each object with the rules text of the other object. (In games involving certain cards that arenâ€™t covered by these rules, other elements of the text box may also be exchanged. See rule 100.7.)
612.6. One card (Volrathâ€™s Shapeshifter) states that an object has the â€œfull textâ€� of another object. This changes not just the text that appears in the objectâ€™s text box and type line, but also changes the text that represents its name, mana cost, color indicator, power, and toughness.
612.7. One card (Spy Kit) states that an object has â€œall names of nonlegendary creature cards.â€� This changes the text that represents the objectâ€™s name. That object has the name of each nonlegendary creature card in the Oracle card reference. (See rule 108.1.)
612.8. Some cards create a continuous effect that sets the name of an object. This changes the text that represents the objectâ€™s name. That object loses any names it had and has only the specified name.
612.9. A name sticker on a permanent or on a card not on the battlefield creates a continuous effect that adds a word to the text that represents the objectâ€™s name. (See rule 123.6.)
612.10. A splice ability changes a spellâ€™s text by adding the rules text of the card with splice to the spell, following that spellâ€™s own rules text. It doesnâ€™t modify or replace any of that spellâ€™s own text. (See rule 702.47, â€œSplice.â€�)
613.1. The values of an objectâ€™s characteristics are determined by starting with the actual object. For a card, that means the values of the characteristics printed on that card. For a token or a copy of a spell or card, that means the values of the characteristics defined by the effect that created it. Then all applicable continuous effects are applied in a series of layers in the following order:
613.2. Within layer 1, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)
613.3. Within layers 2â€“6, apply effects from characteristic-defining abilities first (see rule 604.3), then all other effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a layer. (See rule 613.8.)
613.4. Within layer 7, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order. (See rule 613.7.) Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)
613.5. The application of continuous effects as described by the layer system is continually and automatically performed by the game. All resulting changes to an objectâ€™s characteristics are instantaneous.
613.6. If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers, the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate ones. If an effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer and/or sublayer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed during this process.
613.7. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is usually done using a timestamp system. An effect with an earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.
613.8. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.
613.9. One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another effect does.
613.10. Some continuous effects affect players rather than objects. For example, an effect might give a player protection from red. All such effects are applied in timestamp order after the determination of objectsâ€™ characteristics. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).
613.11. Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects. For example, effects may modify a playerâ€™s maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able. These effects are applied after all other continuous effects have been applied. Continuous effects that affect the costs of spells or abilities are applied according to the order specified in rule 601.2f. All other such effects are applied in timestamp order. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).
614.1. Some continuous effects are replacement effects. Like prevention effects (see rule 615), replacement effects apply continuously as events happenâ€”they arenâ€™t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace that event with a different event. They act like â€œshieldsâ€� around whatever theyâ€™re affecting.
614.2. Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source. See rule 609.7.
614.3. There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a replacement effect. Such effects last until theyâ€™re used up or their duration has expired.
614.4. Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occursâ€”they canâ€™t â€œgo back in timeâ€� and change something thatâ€™s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.
614.5. A replacement effect doesnâ€™t invoke itself repeatedly; it gets only one opportunity to affect an event or any modified events that may replace that event.
614.6. If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that canâ€™t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.
614.7. If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect simply doesnâ€™t do anything.
614.8. Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word â€œinsteadâ€� doesnâ€™t appear on the card but is implicit in the definition of regeneration. â€œRegenerate [permanent]â€� means â€œThe next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and its controller taps it. If itâ€™s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.â€� Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates. See rule 701.19.
614.9. Some effects replace damage dealt to one battle, creature, planeswalker, or player with the same damage dealt to another battle, creature, planeswalker, or player; such effects are called redirection effects. If one of those permanents is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be redirected, or is no longer a battle, creature, or planeswalker when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing. If damage would be redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does nothing.
614.10. An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. â€œSkip [something]â€� is the same as â€œInstead of doing [something], do nothing.â€� Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skippedâ€”any skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.
614.11. Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected playerâ€™s library.
614.12. Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules 614.1câ€“d.) Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects from the permanentâ€™s own static abilities that would apply to it once itâ€™s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.
614.13. An effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield may cause other objects to change zones.
614.14. An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to â€œthe exiled cardsâ€� or to cards â€œexiled with [this object].â€� These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of the replacement event caused by the first. If another object gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They canâ€™t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, â€œLinked Abilities.â€�
614.15. Some replacement effects are not continuous effects. Rather, they are an effect of a resolving spell or ability that replace part or all of that spell or abilityâ€™s own effect(s). Such effects are called self-replacement effects. The text creating a self-replacement effect is usually part of the ability whose effect is being replaced, but the text can be a separate ability, particularly when preceded by an ability word. When applying replacement effects to an event, self-replacement effects are applied before other replacement effects.
614.16. Some replacement effects apply â€œif an effect would create one or more tokensâ€� or â€œif an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent.â€� These replacement effects apply if the effect of a resolving spell or ability creates a token or puts a counter on a permanent, and they also apply if another replacement or prevention effect does so, even if the original event being modified wasnâ€™t itself an effect. 
614.17. Some effects state that something canâ€™t happen. These effects arenâ€™t replacement effects, but follow similar rules.
615.1. Some continuous effects are prevention effects. Like replacement effects (see rule 614), prevention effects apply continuously as events happenâ€”they arenâ€™t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a damage event that would happen and completely or partially prevent the damage that would be dealt. They act like â€œshieldsâ€� around whatever theyâ€™re affecting.
615.2. Many prevention effects apply to damage from a source. See rule 609.7.
615.3. There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a prevention effect. Such effects last until theyâ€™re used up or their duration has expired.
615.4. Prevention effects must exist before the appropriate damage event occursâ€”they canâ€™t â€œgo back in timeâ€� and change something thatâ€™s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.
615.5. Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which may refer to the amount of damage that was prevented. The prevention takes place at the time the original event would have happened; the rest of the effect takes place immediately afterward.
615.6. If damage that would be dealt is prevented, it never happens. A modified event may occur instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that canâ€™t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.
615.7. Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to a specific amount of damageâ€”for example, â€œPrevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.â€� These work like shields. Each 1 damage that would be dealt to the â€œshieldedâ€� permanent or player is prevented. Preventing 1 damage reduces the remaining shield by 1. If damage would be dealt to the shielded permanent or player by two or more applicable sources at the same time, the player or the controller of the permanent chooses which damage the shield prevents. Once the shield has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt normally. Such effects count only the amount of damage; the number of events or sources dealing it doesnâ€™t matter.
615.8. Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to the next time a specific source would deal damage. These effects prevent the next instance of damage from that source, regardless of how much damage that is. Once an instance of damage from that source has been prevented, any subsequent instances of damage that would be dealt by that source are dealt normally.
615.9. Some effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability prevent damage from a source of a playerâ€™s choice with certain properties. When the source would deal damage, the shield rechecks the sourceâ€™s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isnâ€™t prevented or replaced and the shield isnâ€™t used up. See rule 609.7b.
615.10. Some prevention effects generated by static abilities refer to a specific amount of damageâ€”for example, â€œIf a source would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage.â€� Such an effect prevents only the indicated amount of damage in any applicable damage event at any given time. It will apply separately to damage from other applicable events that would happen at the same time, or at a different time.
615.11. Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to each of a number of untargeted creatures. Such an effect creates a prevention shield for each applicable creature when the spell or ability that generates that effect resolves.
615.12. Some effects state that damage â€œcanâ€™t be prevented.â€� If unpreventable damage would be dealt, any applicable prevention effects are still applied to it. Those effects wonâ€™t prevent any damage, but any additional effects they have will take place. Existing damage prevention shields wonâ€™t be reduced by damage that canâ€™t be prevented.
615.13. Some triggered abilities trigger when damage that would be dealt is prevented. Such an ability triggers each time a prevention effect is applied to one or more simultaneous damage events and prevents some or all of that damage.
616.1. If two or more replacement and/or prevention effects are attempting to modify the way an event affects an object or player, the affected objectâ€™s controller (or its owner if it has no controller) or the affected player chooses one to apply, following the steps listed below. If two or more players have to make these choices at the same time, choices are made in APNAP order (see rule 101.4).
616.2. A replacement or prevention effect can become applicable to an event as the result of another replacement or prevention effect that modifies the event.
700.1. Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a spell or ability. The text of triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the event theyâ€™re looking for. One â€œhappeningâ€� may be treated as a single event by one ability and as multiple events by another.
700.2. A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options in a bulleted list preceded by instructions for a player to choose a number of those options, such as â€œChoose one â€”.â€� Each of those options is a mode. Modal cards printed prior to the Khans of Tarkirâ„¢ set didnâ€™t use bulleted lists for the modes; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference so the modes do appear in a bulleted list.
700.3. Some effects cause objects to be temporarily grouped into piles.
700.4. The term dies means â€œis put into a graveyard from the battlefield.â€�
700.5. A playerâ€™s devotion to [color] is equal to the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents that player controls. A playerâ€™s devotion to [color 1] and [color 2] is equal to the number of mana symbols among the mana costs of permanents that player controls that are [color 1], [color 2], or both colors.
700.6. The term historic refers to an object that has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype.
700.7. If an ability uses a phrase such as â€œthis [something]â€� to identify an object, where [something] is a characteristic or other quality, it is referring to that particular object, even if it isnâ€™t the appropriate quality at the time.
700.8. Some cards refer to a playerâ€™s party. A playerâ€™s party consists of up to one Cleric creature that player controls, up to one Rogue creature they control, up to one Warrior creature they control, and up to one Wizard creature they control.
700.9. Some cards refer to modified permanents. A permanent is modified if it has one or more counters on it (see rule 122), if it is equipped (see rule 301.5), or if it is enchanted by an Aura that is controlled by that permanentâ€™s controller (see rule 303.4).
700.10. Some cards refer to a permanent â€œthat was activated this turn.â€� This means that the permanent was the source of an ability that was activated this turn, regardless of whether that permanent still has that activated ability or the player who activated it is still in the game.
700.11. Some cards refer to whether a player has â€œdescended this turn.â€� This means that a permanent card has been put into that playerâ€™s graveyard from anywhere this turn. â€œThe number of times [a player] descended this turnâ€� means â€œthe number of permanent cards put into [that playerâ€™s] graveyard from anywhere this turn.â€� In both cases, no permanent cards put into the playerâ€™s graveyard that turn are required to still be in that graveyard.
700.12. The term outlaw refers to an object that has the Assassin, Mercenary, Pirate, Rogue, and/or Warlock creature types.
700.13. Some cards refer to committing a crime. A player commits a crime as that player casts a spell, activates an ability, or puts a triggered ability on the stack and that spell or ability targets at least one opponent; at least one permanent, spell, or ability an opponent controls; and/or at least one card in an opponentâ€™s graveyard.
700.14. Some abilities trigger â€œWhenever you expend N.â€� A player expends N if they pay a cost to cast a spell and the amount of mana that player spent this turn to cast spells prior to paying that cost was less than N and became at least N after paying that cost.
700.15. The term enter[s] is short for â€œenter[s] the battlefield.â€�
701.1. Most actions described in a cardâ€™s rules text use the standard English definitions of the verbs within, but some specialized verbs are used whose meanings may not be clear. These â€œkeywordsâ€� are game terms; sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings.

703.1. Turn-based actions are game actions that happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin, or when each step and phase ends. Turn-based actions donâ€™t use the stack.
703.2. Turn-based actions are not controlled by any player.
703.3. Whenever a step or phase begins, if itâ€™s a step or phase that has any turn-based action associated with it, those turn-based actions are automatically dealt with first. This happens before state-based actions are checked, before triggered abilities are put on the stack, and before players receive priority.
703.4. The turn-based actions are as follows:
704.1. State-based actions are game actions that happen automatically whenever certain conditions (listed below) are met. State-based actions donâ€™t use the stack.
704.2. State-based actions are checked throughout the game and are not controlled by any player.
704.3. Whenever a player would get priority (see rule 117, â€œTiming and Priorityâ€�), the game checks for any of the listed conditions for state-based actions, then performs all applicable state-based actions simultaneously as a single event. If any state-based actions are performed as a result of a check, the check is repeated; otherwise all triggered abilities that are waiting to be put on the stack are put on the stack, then the check is repeated. Once no more state-based actions have been performed as the result of a check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, the appropriate player gets priority. This process also occurs during the cleanup step (see rule 514), except that if no state-based actions are performed as the result of the stepâ€™s first check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, then no player gets priority and the step ends.
704.4. Unlike triggered abilities, state-based actions pay no attention to what happens during the resolution of a spell or ability.
704.5. The state-based actions are as follows:
704.6. Some variant games include additional state-based actions that arenâ€™t normally applicable:
704.7. If multiple state-based actions would have the same result at the same time, a single replacement effect will replace all of them.
704.8. If a state-based action results in a permanent leaving the battlefield at the same time other state-based actions were performed, that permanentâ€™s last known information is derived from the game state before any of those state-based actions were performed.
705.1. Some cards refer to flipping a coin. A coin used in a flip must be a two-sided object with easily distinguished sides and equal likelihood that either side lands face up. If the coin thatâ€™s being flipped doesnâ€™t have an obvious â€œheadsâ€� or â€œtails,â€� designate one side to be â€œheads,â€� and the other side to be â€œtails.â€� Other methods of randomization may be substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players agree to the substitution. For example, the player may roll an even-sided die and call â€œoddsâ€� or â€œevens,â€� or roll an even-sided die and designate that â€œoddsâ€� means â€œheadsâ€� and â€œevensâ€� means â€œtails.â€�
705.2. Some effects that instruct a player to flip a coin care only about whether the coin comes up heads or tails. No player wins or loses a coin flip for this kind of effect. For all other effects that instruct a player to flip a coin, the player that flips the coin calls â€œheadsâ€� or â€œtails.â€� If the call matches the result, the player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.
705.3. An effect may state that a coin flip has a certain result and/or that a certain player wins a coin flip. In that case, ignore the actual results of that flip and use the indicated results instead. This can cause a player to win a flip that couldnâ€™t otherwise be won.
706.1. An effect that instructs a player to roll a die will specify what kind of die to roll and how many of those dice to roll.
706.2. After the roll, the number indicated on the top face of the die before any modifiers is the natural result. The instruction may include modifiers to the roll which add to or subtract from the natural result. Modifiers may also come from other sources. After considering all applicable modifiers, the final number is the result of the die roll.
706.3. Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice include a results table.
706.4. Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice do not include a results table. The text of those abilities will indicate how to use the results of the die rolls, if at all.
706.5. One card (Celebr-8000) has an ability that instructs a player to roll two dice and has an additional effect if that player â€œrolled doubles.â€� A player has rolled doubles if the result of each of those rolls is equal to the other.
706.6. If a player is instructed to ignore a roll, that roll is considered to have never happened. No abilities trigger because of the ignored roll, and no effects apply to that roll. If that player was instructed to ignore the lowest roll and multiple results are tied for the lowest, the player chooses one of those rolls to be ignored.
706.7. In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that exchange the results of that roll with another value or compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�
706.8. One card (Centaur of Attention) has an ability that instructs a player to roll dice and â€œstoreâ€� those results on it and another ability that allows a player to reroll any number of those results.
707.1. Some objects become or turn another object into a â€œcopyâ€� of a spell, permanent, or card. Some effects create a token thatâ€™s a copy of another object. (Certain older cards were printed with the phrase â€œsearch for a copy.â€� This section doesnâ€™t cover those cards, which have received new text in the Oracle card reference.)
707.2. When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original objectâ€™s characteristics and, for an object on the stack, choices made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). The copiable values are the values derived from the text printed on the object (that text being name, mana cost, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as modified by other copy effects, by its face-down status, and by â€œas . . . entersâ€� and â€œas . . . is turned face upâ€� abilities that set power and toughness (and may also set additional characteristics). Other effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, counters, and stickers are not copied.
707.3. The copyâ€™s copiable values become the copied information, as modified by the copyâ€™s status (see rule 110.5). Objects that copy the object will use the new copiable values.
707.4. Some effects cause a permanent thatâ€™s copying a permanent to copy a different object while remaining on the battlefield. The change doesnâ€™t cause enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities to trigger. This also doesnâ€™t change any noncopy effects presently affecting the permanent.
707.5. An object that enters the battlefield â€œas a copyâ€� or â€œthatâ€™s a copyâ€� of another object becomes a copy as it enters the battlefield. It doesnâ€™t enter the battlefield, and then become a copy of that permanent. If the text thatâ€™s being copied includes any abilities that replace the enters-the-battlefield event (such as â€œenters withâ€� or â€œas [this] entersâ€� abilities), those abilities will take effect. Also, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities of the copy will have a chance to trigger.
707.6. When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that permanent arenâ€™t copied. Instead, if an object enters the battlefield as a copy of another permanent, the objectâ€™s controller will get to make any â€œas [this] enters the battlefieldâ€� choices for it.
707.7. If a pair of linked abilities are copied, those abilities will be similarly linked to one another on the object that copied them. One ability refers only to actions that were taken or objects that were affected by the other. They canâ€™t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the copy may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, â€œLinked Abilities.â€�
707.8. When copying a melded permanent or other double-faced permanent, use the copiable values of the face thatâ€™s currently up to determine the characteristics of the copy. See rule 712, â€œDouble-Faced Cards.â€�
707.9. Copy effects may include modifications or exceptions to the copying process.
707.10. To copy a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto the stack; a copy of a spell isnâ€™t cast and a copy of an activated ability isnâ€™t activated. A copy of a spell or ability copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it, including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs. (See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�) Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell or ability. A copy of a spell is owned by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell or ability is controlled by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no spell card associated with it. A copy of an ability is itself an ability.
707.11. If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something else.
707.12. An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps 601.2aâ€“h of rule 601, â€œCasting Spells,â€� and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.
707.13. One card (Garth One-Eye) instructs a player to create a copy of a card defined by name rather than by indicating an object to be copied. To do so, the player uses the Oracle card reference to determine the characteristics of the copy and creates the copy outside of the game.
707.14. One card (Magar of the Magic Strings) instructs a player to note the name of a particular card in a graveyard and create a copy of the card with the noted name. To do so, use the characteristics of that card as it last existed in the graveyard to determine the copiable values of the copy. (See rule 608.2h.)
708.1. Some cards allow spells and permanents to be face down.
708.2. Face-down spells and face-down permanents have no characteristics other than those listed by the ability or rules that allowed the spell or permanent to be face down. Any listed characteristics are the copiable values of that objectâ€™s characteristics. (See rule 613, â€œInteraction of Continuous Effects,â€� and rule 707, â€œCopying Objects.â€�)
708.3. Objects that are put onto the battlefield face down are turned face down before they enter the battlefield, so the permanentâ€™s enters-the-battlefield abilities wonâ€™t trigger (if triggered) or have any effect (if static).
708.4. Objects that are cast face down are turned face down before they are put onto the stack, so effects that care about the characteristics of a spell will see only the face-down spellâ€™s characteristics. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting an object with these characteristics (and not the face-up objectâ€™s characteristics) are applied to casting this object. The permanent the spell becomes will be a face-down permanent.
708.5. At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the stack or a face-down permanent you control (even if itâ€™s phased out). You canâ€™t look at face-down cards in any other zone or face-down spells or permanents controlled by another player.
708.6. If you control multiple face-down spells or face-down permanents, you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other. This includes, but is not limited to, knowing what ability or rules caused the permanents to be face down, the order spells were cast, the order that face-down permanents entered the battlefield, which creature(s) attacked last turn, and any other differences between face-down spells or permanents. Common methods for distinguishing between face-down objects include using counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those objects in order on the table.
708.7. The ability or rules that allow a permanent to be face down may also allow the permanentâ€™s controller to turn it face up. Spells normally canâ€™t be turned face up.
708.8. As a face-down permanent is turned face up, its copiable values revert to its normal copiable values. Any effects that have been applied to the face-down permanent still apply to the face-up permanent. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield donâ€™t trigger and donâ€™t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.
708.9. If a face-down permanent or a face-down component of a merged permanent moves from the battlefield to any other zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a face-down spell moves from the stack to any zone other than the battlefield, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a player leaves the game, all face-down permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down spells owned by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down spells must be revealed to all players.
708.10. If a face-down permanent becomes a copy of another permanent, its copiable values become the copiable values of that permanent, as modified by its face-down status. Its characteristics therefore remain the same: the characteristics listed by the ability or rules that allowed it to be turned face down. However, if it is turned face up, its copiable values become the values it copied from the other permanent. See rule 707.3.
708.11. If a face-down permanent would have an â€œAs [this permanent] is turned face up . . .â€� ability after itâ€™s turned face up, that ability is applied while that permanent is being turned face up, not afterward.
708.12. If a spell or ability that instructs a player to reveal a face-down permanent needs information about the revealed object, it uses the characteristics of that object ignoring any continuous effects that may be applying to it.
709.1. Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal Magic card back.
709.2. Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
709.3. A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.
709.4. In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves combined.
709.5. Some split cards are permanent cards with a single shared type line. A shared type line on such an object represents two static abilities that function on the battlefield. These are â€œAs long as this permanent doesnâ€™t have the â€˜left half unlockedâ€™ designation, it doesnâ€™t have the name, mana cost, or rules text of this objectâ€™s left halfâ€� and â€œAs long as this permanent doesnâ€™t have the â€˜right half unlockedâ€™ designation, it doesnâ€™t have the name, mana cost, or rules text of this objectâ€™s right half.â€� These abilities, as well as which half of that permanent a characteristic is in, are part of that objectâ€™s copiable values.
710.1. Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the card defines the cardâ€™s normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on the card. The back of a flip card is the normal Magic card back.
710.2. In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the battlefield before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal characteristics of the card. Once a permanent is flipped, its normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness donâ€™t apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.
710.3. You must ensure that itâ€™s clear at all times whether a permanent you control is flipped or not, both when itâ€™s untapped and when itâ€™s tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.
710.4. Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, itâ€™s impossible for it to become unflipped. However, if a flipped permanent leaves the battlefield, it retains no memory of its status. See rule 110.5.
710.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a flip cardâ€™s alternative name, the player may do so.
711.1. Each leveler card has a striated text box and three power/toughness boxes. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols.
711.2. A level symbol is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as â€œN1-N2,â€� or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as â€œN3+.â€� Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as â€œ[P/T].â€�
711.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which level symbol. Leveler cards each contain only one text box.
711.4. Any ability a leveler card has that isnâ€™t preceded by a level symbol is treated normally. In particular, each leveler permanent has its level up ability (see rule 702.87) at all times; it may be activated regardless of how many level counters are on that permanent.
711.5. If the number of level counters on a leveler creature is less than N1 (the first number printed in its {LEVEL N1-N2} symbol), it has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.
711.6. In every zone other than the battlefield, a leveler card has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.
711.7. Some enchantments have the subtype Class and associated abilities that give them a class level. These are not level up abilities and class levels do not interact with level counters. See rule 716, â€œClass Cards.â€�
712.1. A double-faced card has a Magic card face on one side and either a Magic card face or half of an oversized card face on the other. (It does not have a Magic card back.) There are three kinds of double-faced cards: nonmodal double-faced cards (previously called â€œtransforming double-faced cardsâ€�), modal double-faced cards, and meld cards.
712.2. Nonmodal double-faced cards have a Magic card face on each side and include abilities on one or both of their faces that allow the card to either â€œtransformâ€� or â€œconvertâ€� (turn over to its other face) and/or allow the card to be cast or enter the battlefield â€œtransformedâ€� or â€œconvertedâ€� (with its back face up).
712.3. Modal double-faced cards have a Magic card face on each side. These faces are usually independent from one another, but they may have an ability that allows them to â€œtransformâ€� or â€œconvertâ€� on either face.
712.4. Meld cards have a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized card face on the other.
712.5. There are seven specific meld pairs.
712.6. Players who are allowed to look at a double-faced card may look at both sides of that card.
712.7. Players must ensure that double-faced cards in hidden zones are indistinguishable from other cards in the same zone. To do this, the owner of a double-faced card may use completely opaque card sleeves and/or a substitute card (see rule 713). Sanctioned tournaments have additional rules for playing with double-faced cards. See rule 100.6.
712.8. Each face of a double-faced card that isnâ€™t a meld card has its own set of characteristics. The front face of each meld card and the combined face formed by a meld pair each has its own set of characteristics.
712.9. Only permanents represented by double-faced tokens and double-faced cards that are not meld cards can transform or convert. (See rule 701.27, â€œTransform,â€� and rule 701.28, â€œConvert.â€�) If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform or convert any permanent that isnâ€™t represented by a double-faced token or a double-faced card, nothing happens.
712.10. If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform or convert a permanent, and the face that permanent would transform or convert into is an instant or sorcery card face, or is a double-faced token that was created with an instant or sorcery face, nothing happens.
712.11. A double-faced spell is cast with its front face up by default. See rule 601, â€œCasting Spells.â€�
712.12. A player playing a modal double-faced card or a copy of a modal double-faced card as a land chooses one of its faces thatâ€™s a land before putting it onto the battlefield. It enters the battlefield with that face up. See rule 305, â€œLands.â€�
712.13. By default, a resolving double-faced spell that becomes a permanent is put onto the battlefield with the same face up that was face up on the stack.
712.14. A double-faced card put onto the battlefield from a zone other than the stack enters the battlefield with its front face up by default.
712.15. If an effect allows a player to cast a double-faced card as a face-down creature spell, or if a double-faced card enters the battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule or effect that caused it to be face down. That card remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card (see rule 713) and/or opaque sleeves. See rule 708, â€œFace-Down Spells and Permanents.â€�
712.16. Melded permanents and other double-faced permanents canâ€™t be turned face down. If a spell or ability tries to turn a double-faced permanent face down, nothing happens.
712.17. A double-faced card that is exiled face down remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card and/or opaque sleeves. See rule 713, â€œSubstitute Cards.â€�
712.18. When a double-faced permanent transforms or converts, it doesnâ€™t become a new object. Any effects that applied to that permanent will continue to apply to it.
712.19. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player may choose the name of either face of a double-faced card but not both. The player may choose the name of the combined back face of a meld pair.
712.20. If a double-faced card would have an â€œAs [this permanent] transforms . . .â€� ability after it transforms or converts, that ability is applied while that permanent is transforming or converting, not afterward.
712.21. If a melded permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and two cards are put into the appropriate zone.
713.1. A substitute card is a game supplement that can be used to represent a double-faced card or meld card. A substitute card has a normal Magic card back.
713.2. Each substitute card must clearly indicate the name of at least the front face of the card that it represents. Other information from the printed card (e.g. card type, mana cost, and power and toughness) may also be written on the substitute card.
713.3. If a substitute card is used in a deck, the card it represents is set aside prior to the beginning of the game (see rule 103.2a) and must remain available throughout the game. A substitute card canâ€™t be included in a deck unless it is representing a double-faced card or a meld card.
713.4. For all game purposes, the substitute card is considered to be the card itâ€™s representing.
713.5. If the substitute card is face up in a public zone, it should be set aside and the double-faced card or meld card that it represents should be used instead.
714.1. Each Saga card has a striated text box containing a number of chapter symbols. Its illustration is vertically oriented on the right side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.
714.2. A chapter symbol is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability referred to as a chapter ability.
714.3. Sagas use lore counters to track their progress.
714.4. If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent with one or more chapter abilities is greater than or equal to its final chapter number, and it isnâ€™t the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that Sagaâ€™s controller sacrifices it. This state-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
715.1. Adventurer cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.
715.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the left defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while itâ€™s a spell. The cardâ€™s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the right.
715.3. As a player plays an adventurer card, the player chooses whether they play the card normally or as an Adventure.
715.4. In every zone except the stack, and while on the stack not as an Adventure, an adventurer card has only its normal characteristics.
715.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose an adventurer cardâ€™s alternative name, the player may do so.
716.1. Each Class card has a striated text box containing two class level bars. Its illustration is vertically oriented on the left side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.
716.2. A class level bar is a keyword ability that represents both an activated ability and a static ability. A class level bar includes the activation cost of its activated ability and a level number. Any abilities printed within the same text box section as the class level bar are part of its static ability.
716.3. Any ability printed on a Class card that isnâ€™t preceded by a class level bar is treated normally. In particular, the Class has the ability printed in its top text box section at all times. That ability may affect the game if itâ€™s a static ability, it may trigger if itâ€™s a triggered ability, and it can be activated if itâ€™s an activated ability.
716.4. Some older creature cards, called leveler cards, have level up abilities that add level counters to them. These are not the same as class level abilities. Level counters do not interact with Class cards, and class levels do not interact with leveler cards. See rule 702.87, â€œLevel Up,â€� and rule 711, â€œLeveler Cards.â€�
717.1. Attraction is an artifact subtype seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Each Attraction has an â€œAstrotoriumâ€� card back rather than a traditional Magic card back and has a column of circled numbers on the right side of its text box. Numbers in white text on a brightly colored background are said to be â€œlit upâ€� on those cards. Note that multiple Attraction cards with the same English name may have different numbers lit up. You can see each Attraction cardâ€™s possible combinations of lights at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
717.2. Attraction cards do not begin the game in a playerâ€™s deck and do not count toward maximum or minimum deck sizes. Rather, a player who chooses to play with Attraction cards begins the game with a supplementary Attraction deck that exists in the command zone. Each Attraction deck is shuffled before the game begins (see rule 103.3a).
717.3. Effects can cause an Attraction card to enter the battlefield from the command zone. See rule 701.51, â€œOpen an Attraction.â€�
717.4. As a playerâ€™s precombat main phase begins, a player who controls one or more Attractions rolls to visit their Attractions. See rules 703.4g and 701.52, â€œRoll to Visit Your Attractions.â€� This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack.
717.5. Each Attraction card has an ability that begins with the word â€œVisitâ€� followed by a long dash in its rules text. This is a visit ability. A visit ability triggers whenever you roll to visit your Attractions and the result matches one of the lit-up numbers. See rule 702.159, â€œVisit.â€�
717.6. If a card with an Astrotorium card back would be put into a zone other than the battlefield, exile, or the command zone from anywhere, instead its owner puts it into the command zone. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5.
718.1. Prototype cards have a two-part frame, with a smaller frame inset below the type line of the card. The inset frame contains the prototype keyword ability as well as a second set of power, toughness, and mana cost characteristics.
718.2. The mana cost, power, and toughness in the inset frame represent alternative characteristics that the object may have while it is a spell or while it is a permanent on the battlefield. The cardâ€™s normal characteristics appear as usual.
718.3. As a player casts a prototype card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or cast it as a prototyped spell using the prototype keyword ability (see rule 702.160, â€œPrototypeâ€�).
718.4. In every zone except the stack or the battlefield, and while on the stack or the battlefield when not cast as a prototyped spell, a prototype card has only its normal characteristics.
718.5. A prototype cardâ€™s characteristics other than its power, toughness, and mana cost (and other than color) remain the same whether it was cast as a prototyped spell or cast normally.
719.1. Each Case cardâ€™s illustration is vertically oriented on the left side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.
719.2. The Case frame has no additional rules meaning.
719.3. Case cards have two special keyword abilities that appear before a long dash and represent a triggered ability and an ability that may be static, triggered, or activated. 
720.1. Omen cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.
720.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the left defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while itâ€™s a spell. The cardâ€™s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the right.
720.3. As a player casts an omen card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or as an Omen.
720.4. In every zone except the stack, and while on the stack not as an Omen, an omen card has only its normal characteristics.
720.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose an omen cardâ€™s alternative name, the player may do so.
721.1. Each station card has a striated text box and may have one or more power/toughness boxes. The text box of a station card contains one or two station symbols. Station cards also usually have the station keyword ability (see rule 702.184).
721.2. A station symbol represents a static ability. The station symbol includes a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as â€œ{N+}.â€� Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a station symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of any power and toughness boxes printed within that striation, indicated here as [P/T].
721.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which station symbol. Station cards each contain only one text box.
721.4. Any ability a station card has that isnâ€™t preceded by a station symbol is treated normally. In particular, each station card has its station ability (see rule 702.184) at all times. That ability may be activated regardless of how many charge counters are on it.
722.1. Some cards allow a player to control another player during that playerâ€™s next turn. This effect applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes. The affected player is controlled during the entire turn; the effect doesnâ€™t end until the beginning of the next turn.
722.2. Two cards (Word of Command and Opposition Agent) allow a player to control another player for a limited duration.
722.3. Only control of the player changes. All objects are controlled by their normal controllers. A player whoâ€™s being controlled during their turn is still the active player.
722.4. If information about an object in the game would be visible to the player being controlled, itâ€™s visible to both that player and the controller of the player. If information about cards outside the game would be visible to the player being controlled, itâ€™s visible only to that player, not the controller of the player.
722.5. While controlling another player, a player makes all choices and decisions the controlled player is allowed to make or is told to make by the rules or by any objects. This includes choices and decisions about what to play, and choices and decisions called for by spells and abilities.
722.6. The controller of another player canâ€™t make that player concede. A player may concede the game at any time, even if they are controlled by another player. See rule 104.3a.
722.7. The effect that gives control of a player to another player may restrict the actions the controlled player is allowed to take or specify actions that the controlled player must take.
722.8. A player who controls another player also continues to make their own choices and decisions.
722.9. An effect may give a player control of themselves. That player will make their own decisions and choices as normal.
723.1. Some cards end the turn. When an effect ends the turn, follow these steps in order, as they differ from the normal process for resolving spells and abilities (see rule 608, â€œResolving Spells and Abilitiesâ€�).
723.2. One card (Mandate of Peace) ends the combat phase. When an effect ends the combat phase, follow these steps in order, as they differ from the normal process for resolving spells and abilities (see rule 608, â€œResolving Spells and Abilitiesâ€�).
724.1. The monarch is a designation a player can have. There is no monarch in a game until an effect instructs a player to become the monarch.
724.2. There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. This is an exception to rule 113.8. The full texts of these abilities are â€œAt the beginning of the monarchâ€™s end step, that player draws a cardâ€� and â€œWhenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch.â€�
724.3. Only one player can be the monarch at a time. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch ceases to be the monarch.
724.4. If the monarch leaves the game, the active player becomes the monarch at the same time as that player leaves the game. If the active player is leaving the game or if there is no active player, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch. If no player still in the game can become the monarch, the game continues with no monarch.
724.5. If the result of a continuous effect generated by a static ability is determined based on who is currently the monarch, but there is no monarch in the game as that effect begins to apply, that effect does nothing until a player becomes the monarch. See rule 613, â€œContinuous Effects.â€�
725.1. The initiative is a designation a player can have. There is no initiative in a game until an effect instructs a player to take the initiative. A player who currently has the initiative designation is said to have the initiative.
725.2. There are three inherent triggered abilities associated with having the initiative. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who had the initiative at the time the abilities triggered. This is an exception to rule 113.8. The full text of these abilities are â€œAt the beginning of the upkeep of the player who has the initiative, that player ventures into Undercity,â€� â€œWhenever one or more creatures a player controls deal combat damage to the player who has the initiative, the controller of those creatures takes the initiative,â€� and â€œWhenever a player takes the initiative, that player ventures into Undercity.â€� See rule 701.49, â€œVenture into the Dungeon.â€�
725.3. Only one player can have the initiative at a time. As a player takes the initiative, the player who currently has the initiative ceases to have it.
725.4. If the player who has the initiative leaves the game, the active player takes the initiative at the same time that player leaves the game. If the active player is leaving the game or if there is no active player, the next player in turn order takes the initiative.
725.5. If the player who currently has the initiative is instructed to take the initiative, this causes the last triggered ability in 725.2 to trigger but does not create a second initiative designation.
726.1. One card (Karn Liberated) restarts the game. A game that is restarted immediately ends. No players in that game win, lose, or draw that game. All players in that game when it ended then start a new game following the procedures set forth in rule 103, â€œStarting the Game,â€� with the following exception:
726.2. All Magic cards involved in the game that was restarted when it ended, including phased-out permanents and nontraditional Magic cards, are involved in the new game, even if those cards were not originally involved in the restarted game. Ownership of cards in the new game doesnâ€™t change, regardless of their location when the new game begins.
726.3. Because each player draws seven cards when the new game begins, any player with fewer than seven cards in their library will lose the game when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep step of the first turn, regardless of any mulligans that player takes. (See rule 704, â€œState-Based Actions.â€�)
726.4. The effect that restarts the game finishes resolving just before the first turnâ€™s untap step. If the spell or ability that generated that effect has additional instructions, those instructions are followed at this time. No player has priority, and any triggered abilities that trigger as a result will go on the stack the next time a player receives priority, usually during the first turnâ€™s upkeep step.
726.5. Effects may exempt certain cards from the procedure that restarts the game. These cards are not in their ownerâ€™s deck as the new game begins.
726.6. If a Magic subgame (see rule 728) is restarted, the main game is unaffected. Main-game effects that refer to the winner or loser of the subgame now refer to the winner or loser of the restarted subgame.
726.7. If a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801) is restarted, all players in the game are involved, regardless of the range of influence of the player who controls the ability that restarted the game.
727.1. Rad counters are a kind of counter a player can have (see rule 122, â€œCountersâ€�). There is an inherent triggered ability associated with rad counters. This ability has no source and is controlled by the active player. This is an exception to rule 113.8. The full text of this ability is â€œAt the beginning of each playerâ€™s precombat main phase, if that player has one or more rad counters, that player mills a number of cards equal to the number of rad counters they have. For each nonland card milled this way, that player loses 1 life and removes one rad counter from themselves.â€�
728.1. One card (Shahrazad) allows players to play a Magic subgame.
728.2. As the subgame starts, an entirely new set of game zones is created. Each player takes all the cards in their main-game library, moves them to their subgame library, and shuffles them. No other cards in a main-game zone are moved to their corresponding subgame zone, except as specified in rules 728.2aâ€“c. Randomly determine which player goes first. The subgame proceeds like a normal game, following all other rules in rule 103, â€œStarting the Game.â€�
728.3. Because each player draws seven cards when a game begins, any player with fewer than seven cards in their deck will lose the subgame when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep step of the first turn, regardless of any mulligans that player takes. (See rule 704, â€œState-Based Actions.â€�)
728.4. All objects in the main game and all cards outside the main game are considered outside the subgame (except those specifically brought into the subgame). All players not currently in the subgame are considered outside the subgame.
728.5. At the end of a subgame, each player takes all traditional cards they own that are in the subgame other than those in the subgame command zone, puts them into their main-game library, then shuffles them. This includes cards in the subgameâ€™s exile zone and cards that represent phased-out permanents as the subgame ends. Except as specified in rules 728.5aâ€“c, all other objects in the subgame cease to exist, as do the zones created for the subgame. The main game continues from the point at which it was discontinued: First, the spell or ability that created the subgame finishes resolving, even if it was created by a spell card thatâ€™s no longer on the stack. Then, if any main-game abilities triggered while the subgame was in progress due to cards being removed from the main game, those abilities are put onto the stack.
728.6. A subgame can be created within a subgame. The existing subgame becomes the main game in relation to the new subgame.
729.1. One keyword causes an object to merge with a permanent. See rule 702.140, â€œMutate.â€�
729.2. To merge an object with a permanent, place that object on top of or under that permanent. That permanent becomes a merged permanent represented by the card or copy that represented that object in addition to any other components that were representing it.
729.3. If a merged permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and each of the individual components are put into the appropriate zone.
730.1. Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts with neither designation. â€œIt becomes dayâ€� and â€œit becomes nightâ€� refer to the game gaining the day or night designation. It can become day or night through the daybound and nightbound keyword abilities (see rule 702.145). Other effects can also make it day or night. Once it has become day or night, the game will have exactly one of those designations from that point forward.
730.2. As the second part of the untap step, the game checks the previous turn to see if the gameâ€™s day/night designation should change. See rule 502, â€œUntap Step.â€�
731.1. When playing a game, players typically make use of mutually understood shortcuts rather than explicitly identifying each game choice (either taking an action or passing priority) a player makes.
731.2. Taking a shortcut follows the following procedure.
731.3. Sometimes a loop can be fragmented, meaning that each player involved in the loop performs an independent action that results in the same game state being reached multiple times. If that happens, the active player (or, if the active player is not involved in the loop, the first player in turn order who is involved) must then make a different game choice so the loop does not continue.
731.4. If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game is a draw. (See rules 104.4b and 104.4f.)
731.5. No player can be forced to perform an action that would end a loop other than actions called for by objects involved in the loop.
731.6. If a loop contains an effect that says â€œ[A] unless [B],â€� where [A] and [B] are each actions, no player can be forced to perform [B] to break the loop. If no player chooses to perform [B], the loop will continue as though [A] were mandatory.
732.1. If a player takes an illegal action or starts to take an action but canâ€™t legally complete it, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was casting a spell, the spell returns to the zone it came from. Each player may also reverse any legal mana abilities that player activated while making the illegal play, unless mana from those abilities or from any triggered mana abilities they caused to trigger was spent on another mana ability that wasnâ€™t reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library, moved cards from a library to any zone other than the stack, caused a library to be shuffled, or caused cards from a library to be revealed.
732.2. When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had priority retains it and may take another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action allowed by the rules.
800.1. A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.
800.2. These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.
800.3. Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be found at WPN.wizards.com/en/rules-documents.
800.4. Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.
800.5. Unless a chosen variant or option prescribes otherwise, seating order is determined by any mutually agreeable method. For example, players could agree to remain where they were before the game began, roll dice to determine seating order, and so on.
800.6. In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes doesnâ€™t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.
800.7. In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesnâ€™t skip the draw step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. See rule 103.8.
801.1. Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. Itâ€™s always used in the Emperor variant (see rule 809), and itâ€™s often used for games involving five or more players.
801.2. A playerâ€™s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that playerâ€™s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a playerâ€™s range of influence are also within that playerâ€™s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making choices, and winning the game.
801.3. Creatures can attack only opponents within their controllerâ€™s range of influence, planeswalkers controlled by those opponents, and battles protected by those opponents. If no opponents are within a playerâ€™s range of influence, creatures that player controls canâ€™t attack.
801.4. Objects and players outside a playerâ€™s range of influence canâ€™t be the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.
801.5. Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used.
801.6. A player canâ€™t activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.
801.7. A triggered ability doesnâ€™t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of influence of its sourceâ€™s controller.
801.8. An Aura canâ€™t enchant an object or player outside its controllerâ€™s range of influence. If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its ownerâ€™s graveyard as a state-based action. See rule 704.
801.9. An Equipment canâ€™t equip an object outside its controllerâ€™s range of influence, and a Fortification canâ€™t fortify an object outside its controllerâ€™s range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.
801.10. Spells and abilities canâ€™t affect objects or players outside their controllerâ€™s range of influence. The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of the effect will work normally.
801.11. If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its controllerâ€™s range of influence. It doesnâ€™t see objects or events outside its controllerâ€™s range of influence.
801.12. The â€œworld ruleâ€� (see rule 704.5k) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within its controllerâ€™s range of influence.
801.13. Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain instructions that canâ€™t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions. See rule 614, â€œReplacement Effects,â€� and rule 615, â€œPrevention Effects.â€�
801.14. If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that playerâ€™s opponents within that playerâ€™s range of influence lose the game instead.
801.15. If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell or abilityâ€™s controller and all players within that playerâ€™s range of influence. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.
801.16. If the game somehow enters a â€œloopâ€� of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object thatâ€™s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.
801.17. Effects that restart the game (see rule 726) are exempt from the limited range of influence option. All players in the game will be involved in the new game.
801.18. In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. See rule 901, â€œPlanechase.â€�
802.1. Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.
802.2. As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesnâ€™t choose an opponent to become the defending player. Instead, all the attacking playerâ€™s opponents are defending players during the combat phase.
802.3. As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they choose a defending player, a planeswalker controlled by a defending player, or a battle protected by a defending player for it to attack. See rule 508, â€œDeclare Attackers Step.â€�
802.4. If more than one player is being attacked, controls a planeswalker thatâ€™s being attacked, or protects a battle thatâ€™s being attacked, each defending player in APNAP order declares blockers as the declare blockers step begins. (See rule 101.4 and rule 509, â€œDeclare Blockers Step.â€�) The first defending player declares all their blocks, then the second defending player, and so on.
802.5. Combat damage is assigned in APNAP order. Other than that, the combat damage step proceeds just as in a two-player game. See rule 510, â€œCombat Damage Step.â€�
803.1. Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right rules.
804.1. The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it can be used in other variants that allow players to compete in teams. Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually donâ€™t use this option.
804.2. Each creature has the ability â€œ{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Activate only as a sorcery.â€�
805.1. Some multiplayer games between teams use the shared team turns option. Itâ€™s always used in the Two-Headed Giant variant (see rule 810) and the Archenemy casual variant (see rule 904). It can be used only if the members of each team are sitting in adjacent seats.
805.2. Within each team, the player seated in the rightmost seat from that teamâ€™s perspective is the primary player. If the players on a team canâ€™t agree on a choice, such as which creatures attack or what order triggered abilities are put on the stack, the primary player makes that choice.
805.3. The methods described in rule 103.1 are used to determine which team will take the first turn. The team determined this way is the starting team.
805.4. Each team takes turns rather than each player.
805.5. Teams have priority, not individual players.
805.6. The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see rule 101.4) is modified if the shared team turns option is used. If multiple teams would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first the active team makes any choices required, then each nonactive team in turn order makes any choices required. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first each player on the active team makes any choices required in whatever order they like, then the players on each nonactive team in turn order do the same. Once all choices have been made, the actions happen simultaneously.
805.7. If multiple triggered abilities have triggered since the last time a team received priority, the members of the active team put all triggered abilities any of them controls on the stack in any order they choose, then the members of each nonactive team in turn order do the same.
805.8. If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step to that playerâ€™s turn, that playerâ€™s team takes the extra turn, phase, or step. If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that playerâ€™s team does so. If a single effect causes more than one player on the same team to add or skip the same step, phase, or turn, that team adds or skips only that step, phase, or turn. If an effect causes a player to control another player, the first player controls the affected playerâ€™s team.
805.9. Any ability that refers to the â€œactive playerâ€� refers to one specific active player, not to all of the active players. The abilityâ€™s controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is applied.
805.10. The shared team turns option uses different combat rules than other multiplayer options.
806.1. In Free-for-All multiplayer games, a group of players compete as individuals against each other.
806.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Free-for-All variant uses the following default options.
806.3. The players are randomly seated around the table.
807.1. The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant, in which a group of players compete against each other as individuals. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more players.
807.2. Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the following default options.
807.3. The players are seated at random.
807.4. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers keep track of which players are currently taking turns. Each turn marker represents an active playerâ€™s turn.
807.5. Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker represents its own stack.
808.1. Team vs. Team games are played with two or more teams. Each team may have any number of players on it.
808.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players sit.
808.3. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Team vs. Team variant uses the following default options.
808.4. To determine which player goes first, randomly choose a team. If that team has an odd number of players, the player in its center seat goes first. If that team has an even number of players, the player to the left of its midpoint goes first. Turn order goes to the playersâ€™ left.
808.5. In the Team vs. Team variant, a teamâ€™s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each otherâ€™s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates canâ€™t manipulate each otherâ€™s cards or permanents.
809.1. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each.
809.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which itâ€™s seated. Each team has one emperor, who sits in the middle of the team. The remaining players on the team are generals whose job is to protect the emperor.
809.3. The Emperor variant uses the following default options.
809.4. Randomly determine which emperor goes first. Turn order goes to the playersâ€™ left.
809.5. The Emperor variant includes the following specifications for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)
809.6. The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally sized teams. If the teams have more than three players, the range of influence of each player should be adjusted.
809.7. In the Emperor variant, a teamâ€™s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each otherâ€™s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates canâ€™t manipulate each otherâ€™s cards or permanents.
810.1. Two-Headed Giant games are played with two teams of two players each.
810.2. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the shared team turns option. (See rule 805.)
810.3. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players sit.
810.4. Each team has a shared life total, which starts at 30 life.
810.5. With the exception of life total and poison counters, a teamâ€™s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared in the Two-Headed Giant variant. Teammates may review each otherâ€™s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates canâ€™t manipulate each otherâ€™s cards or permanents.
810.6. The team who plays first skips the draw step of its first turn.
810.7. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the combat rules for the shared team turns option (see rule 805.10). This is a change from previous rules.
810.8. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule 104), with the following additions and specifications.
810.9. Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to the teamâ€™s shared life total.
810.10. Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison counters are shared by the team.
810.11. The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players. For each player a team has beyond the second, that teamâ€™s starting life total is increased by 15 and the number of poison counters required for the team to lose is increased by five. (These variants are called Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)
811.1. Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.
811.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the following default options.
811.3. At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out.
811.4. A player canâ€™t attack opponents who arenâ€™t seated next to them, planeswalkers that arenâ€™t controlled by opponents seated next to them, or battles that arenâ€™t protected by opponents seated next to them.
811.5. In the Alternating Teams variant, a teamâ€™s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates canâ€™t review each otherâ€™s hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss strategies at any time. Teammates canâ€™t manipulate each otherâ€™s cards or permanents.
900.1. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for certain casual game variants. It is by no means comprehensive.
900.2. The casual variants detailed here use supplemental zones, rules, cards, and other game implements not used in traditional Magic games.
901.1. In the Planechase variant, plane cards and phenomenon cards add additional abilities and randomness to the game. The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
901.2. A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, â€œFree-for-All Variant.â€�
901.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a supplementary planar deck of at least ten plane and/or phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule 311, â€œPlanes,â€� and rule 312, â€œPhenomena.â€�)
901.4. All plane and phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâ€™re part of a planar deck and while theyâ€™re face up.
901.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If itâ€™s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule 103.7.) No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane.
901.6. The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldnâ€™t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
901.7. Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone. The cardâ€™s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
901.8. Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the â€œplaneswalking ability.â€� The full text of this ability is â€œWhenever you roll the Planeswalker symbol on the planar die, planeswalk.â€� (See rule 701.31, â€œPlaneswalk.â€�) This ability has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception to rule 113.8.
901.9. Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesnâ€™t use the stack. Note that this number wonâ€™t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule 116.2i.)
901.10. When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave the game. (See rule 800.4a.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game.
901.11. After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has â€œplaneswalked.â€� Continuous effects with durations that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule 701.31.
901.12. A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.
901.13. In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. (See rule 801, â€œLimited Range of Influence Option.â€�)
901.14. In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same time.
901.15. Single Planar Deck Option
902.1. In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play the role of a famous character. Each player will have one face-up vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game. The Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
902.2. A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.
902.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a vanguard card. Each vanguard card is placed face up next to its ownerâ€™s library before the game begins. All vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game.
902.4. Each playerâ€™s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.
902.5. Each playerâ€™s starting hand size is seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
902.6. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.
902.7. Any abilities of a face-up vanguard card in the command zone function from that zone. The cardâ€™s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
903.1. In the Commander variant, a variant created and popularized by fans, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deckâ€™s commander. The Commander variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
903.2. A Commander game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, â€œFree-for-All Variant.â€�
903.3. Each deck has a legendary card designated as its commander. That card must be either (a) a creature card, (b) a Vehicle card, or (c) a Spacecraft card with one or more power/toughness boxes. This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.
903.4. The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that cardâ€™s mana cost or rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule 604.3) or color indicator (see rule 204).
903.5. Each Commander deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.
903.6. At the start of the game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone. Then each player shuffles the remaining cards of their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Those cards become the playerâ€™s library.
903.7. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 40 and draws a hand of seven cards.
903.8. A player may cast a commander they own from the command zone. A commander cast from the command zone costs an additional {2} for each previous time the player casting it has cast it from the command zone that game. This additional cost is informally known as the â€œcommander tax.â€�
903.9. A commander may return to the command zone during a Commander game.
903.10. The Commander variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)
903.11. Except via rules, special actions, and effects that specifically bring cards into Commander games from outside the game, traditional cards from outside the game cannot be brought into a Commander game.
903.12. Brawl Option
903.13. Commander Draft
904.1. In the Archenemy variant, a team of players faces off against a single opponent strengthened with powerful scheme cards. The Archenemy variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
904.2. The default setup for an Archenemy game is the Team vs. Team multiplayer variant (see rule 808) involving exactly two teams. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) and the shared team turns option (see rule 805) are used; no other multiplayer options are used.
904.3. In addition to the normal game materials, the archenemy needs a supplementary scheme deck of at least twenty scheme cards. A scheme deck may contain no more than two of any card with a particular English name. (See rule 314, â€œSchemes.â€�)
904.4. All scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâ€™re part of a scheme deck and while theyâ€™re face up.
904.5. The archenemyâ€™s starting life total is 40. Each other playerâ€™s starting life total is 20.
904.6. Rather than a randomly determined player, the archenemy takes the first turn of the game.
904.7. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.
904.8. Any abilities of a face-up scheme card in the command zone function from that zone. The cardâ€™s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
904.9. Immediately after the archenemyâ€™s precombat main phase begins during each of their turns, that player moves the top card of their scheme deck off that scheme deck and turns it face up. This is called â€œsetting that scheme in motion.â€� (See rule 701.32.) This turn-based action doesnâ€™t use the stack. Abilities of that scheme card that trigger â€œWhen you set this scheme in motionâ€� trigger.
904.10. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its ownerâ€™s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
904.11. Once an ongoing scheme card is set in motion, it remains face up in the command zone until an ability causes it to be abandoned (see rule 701.33).
904.12. Supervillain Rumble Option
904.13. Archenemy Commander Option
905.1. The Conspiracy Draft variant consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Conspiracy Draft variant uses Magic: The Gatheringâ€”ConspiracyÂ® and/or Conspiracy: Take the Crown booster packs by default.
905.2. Some cards have abilities that function during the draft.
905.3. A Conspiracy Draft game is a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, â€œFree-for-All Variant.â€�
905.4. At the start of the game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone.
905.5. The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.
905.6. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.
