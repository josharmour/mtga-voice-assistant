    "\\n",
    "*   **Analyze win rates by rank:** This would help us understand how card performance varies across different skill levels.\\n",
    "*   **Identify top-performing cards for different ranks:** This would allow us to provide more targeted recommendations to players.\\n",
    "*   **Filter data by rank:** This would allow us to focus our analysis on specific player segments, such as Mythic or Diamond players.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "### 2. Expand Dataset Scope\\n",
    "The current dataset only includes data for a limited number of sets and game formats. To improve the coverage of our analysis, we should:\\n",
    "\\n",
    "*   **Include more sets:** This would allow us to analyze trends across a wider range of Magic: The Gathering history.\\n",
    "*   **Include more game formats:** This would allow us to provide recommendations for a wider range of players.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "### 3. Address Data Completeness\\n",
    "While the current dataset is relatively complete, there are some missing values that should be addressed. We should investigate the cause of these missing values and implement a strategy for handling them, such as imputation or removal of incomplete records.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "### 4. Sample Size Calculations\\n",
    "To ensure that our analysis is statistically significant, we should perform sample size calculations to determine the minimum amount of data required for our analysis. This will help us to ensure that our conclusions are reliable and not due to chance."
