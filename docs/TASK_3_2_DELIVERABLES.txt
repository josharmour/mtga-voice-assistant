🚀 USAGE EXAMPLE:

```python
from mtg_action_space import MTGActionSpace, Phase

# Initialize action space
action_space = MTGActionSpace()

# Generate actions for current game state
actions = action_space.generate_possible_actions(
    game_state=game_state,
    current_phase=Phase.PRECOMBAT_MAIN,
    decision_context='Aggressive_Creature_Play'
)

# Integrate with transformer encoder
result = action_space.integrate_with_transformer_state(
    transformer_output=state_tensor,
    game_state=game_state,
    current_phase=Phase.PRECOMBAT_MAIN,
    decision_context='Aggressive_Creature_Play'
